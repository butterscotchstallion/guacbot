by Stephen Lendman
On June 21, Obama's Justice Department charged Snowden with espionage. It did so ruthlessly, irresponsibly and unconstitutionally. It wrongfully accused him of violating 1917 Espionage Act provisions.
It was enacted during WW I. It's long ago outdated. It has no current relevance. It belongs in history's dustbin.
It was about interfering with military operations, supporting enemies, promoting insubordination in the ranks, or challenging military recruitment.
At stake are fundamental First Amendment rights. Without them all others are at risk. In Texas v. Johnson, Supreme Court Justice William Brennan wrote the majority opinion, saying:
&quot;(I)f there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable.&quot;
Justice Hugo Black once said: &quot;Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose dec&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136877-2013-06-22-edward-snowden-charged-under-the-espionage-act.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

by Stephen Lendman

Obama's a war criminal multiple times over. He bears full responsibility for genocidal crimes.

In a May London Guardian interview, Cornel West said:

&amp;quot;We elected a black president and that means we are less racist now than we used to be. That's beautiful.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;But when you look at the prison industrial complex and the new Jim Crow: levels of massive unemployment and the decrepit unemployment system, indecent housing: white supremacy is still operating in the US, even with a brilliant black face in a high place called the White House.&amp;quot; 
Obama's &amp;quot;tied to Wall Street. And at this point he is a war criminal. You can't meet every Tuesday with a killer list and continually have drones drop bombs.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;You can do that once or twice and say: 'I shouldn't have done that, I've got to stop.' But when you do it month in, month out, year in, year out - that's a pattern of behavior.&amp;quot;

No way anyone in our weak ass congress would
dare say this. Clare Daly of the Irish Parliament verbally rapes Obama
and exposes him for the war mongering liar that he is. She accused the
parliament of pimping out her nation like prostitutes for Obama. 

She
also accuses Obama of hypocrisy because he is calling for peace in
Syria while at the same time funding weapons to terrorists to
destabilize the nation.

by Stephen Lendman

One a warrior, always one. Clark hasn't forgotten. His credentials are notorious. He's a war criminal. He's also a whistleblower. More on that below. 
He formerly commanded NATO. From March 24 - June 19, 1999, he led naked aggression against Yugoslavia. For 78 days, hundreds of warplanes attacked mercilessly. About 3,000 sorties were flown. 
Thousands of tons of ordnance were dropped. Hundreds of ground-launched cruise missiles were used. 
Nearly everything was struck. Massive destruction and disruption followed. An estimated $100 billion in damage was caused. A humanitarian disaster resulted. Environmental contamination was extensive.

Many thousands were killed, injured or displaced. Two million people lost livelihoods. Homes and communities were destroyed.

Lawless aggression was called humanitarian intervention. It was prelude for worse to come.

An avenue to Eurasia was opened. A permanent US military pre&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136855-2013-06-21-general-wesley-clark-whistleblower-warrior.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

by Stephen Lendman

America represents the worst of rogue governance. So does Israel. They menace humanity. They persecute their best. They honor their worst. 
Peacemakers are scorned. Waging war on humanity's rewarded. On March 21, Obama received Israel's Medal of Distinction. It's also called the President's Medal. 
It's Israel's highest civil award. It's for individuals &amp;quot;who have made an outstanding contribution to the State of Israel or to humanity, through their talents, services, or in any other form.&amp;quot;

In 2012, Henry Kissinger won. His rap sheet includes decades of crimes of war, against humanity and genocide. Israel rewarded his New World Order ruthlessness. It didn't surprise. 
Obama replicates his viciousness writ large. Bill Clinton has his own cross to bear. He's Israel's newest honoree. Shimon Peres established the award. 
One war criminal honored another. Peres bears direct responsibility for decades of col&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136854-2013-06-21-another-israeli-war-criminal-of-the-year-award.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

by Stephen Lendman

On June 3, McClatchy's foreign staff headlined &amp;quot;US publishes details of missile base Israel wanted kept secret.&amp;quot; More on that below.

Last November 28, the Washington Post headlined &amp;quot;US overseeing mysterious construction in Israel.&amp;quot; A previous article discussed it. Washington and Israel partner in imperial operations. Expensive projects are included. According to WaPo:

&amp;quot;The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to supervise construction of a five-story underground facility for an Israel Defense Forces complexâ?¦.&amp;quot;

It's called &amp;quot;Site 911.&amp;quot; It'll be built at an Israeli air force base near Tel Aviv. It's precise location is secret. Construction will take two years or longer. 
Time frames are often extended. Cost is expected to be about $100 million. Expect double or more spent perhaps before completion.

The Israeli facility will &amp;quot;have classrooms on Level 1, an a&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136838-2013-06-21-washington-funds-secret-israeli-ballistic-missile-base.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

			<title>What Are Reasonable Gold Market Expectations?</title>

With that as context, what can we expect from gold moving forward? Let's start with the short term.
Full market capitulation is underway. Headlines about gold are almost universally negative today, and all about selling. This feeds on itself, and the process may not be over. In this kind of environment, prices will overshoot to the downside. In other words, the bottom may not be in.
What if we get more short-term pain?
Differentiate between short-term sentiment and long-term reality. It's not deleveraging and fear that has hit our sector like it did in 2008, but renewed confidence in the broader markets and lack of higher inflation rates that many expected by now. The current thinking by sellers is that crisis has been averted and therefore there's no need to own gold.
Contrast the selling by these short-sighted investors against record levels&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136837-2013-06-21-what-are-reasonable-gold-market-expectations.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

&amp;nbsp;

Jordan's version is called Going to Arizona.&amp;nbsp; Jordan Page Rocks!&amp;nbsp; I apologize for not bringing my trusty tripod.&amp;nbsp; I did my best though.&amp;nbsp; While at Freedom fest, it became clear to me that Jordan Page is the best musician I have ever heard.&amp;nbsp; Being he is the best he needs to have a triple Titanium single!&amp;nbsp; So you guessed it that is exactly what we are going to do.&amp;nbsp; You can choose to participate by forwarding this video and have it go Viral!&amp;nbsp; Dig?

I have to ask you being your reading this far, what is the difference between someone like Garth Brooks playing at the Oklahoma County Fair and Garth Brooks with a Triple Platinum Cd?&amp;nbsp; whew, I almost said record!&amp;nbsp; LOL.&amp;nbsp; The difference is PROMOTION.&amp;nbsp; That's it.&amp;nbsp; Well I know in the freedom Community, we have the best lists so lets do the movement that Ron Paul r&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136832-2013-06-21-jordan-page-freedom-fest.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

by Stephen Lendman
Jack Kennedy was America's last peace president. He underwent a spiritual transformation. He changed from cold warrior to peacemaker. 
He wanted nuclear weapons abolished. He urged &quot;general and complete disarmament.&quot; He wanted force-fed Pax Americana ended.
He assumed great risk. Nearly all his top advisors disapproved. Pentagon commanders opposed him. So did most congressional members. CIA officials weren't pleased.
Kennedy was vulnerable. He knew it. He accepted the risk. It cost him his life. He was assassinated weeks after signing the US/Soviet Russia Limited Test Ban Treaty and National Security Action Memorandum Number 263.
It called for removing 1,000 US troops from Vietnam by yearend. It mandated all American forces out by December 1965.
Obama's no Jack Kennedy. On April 5, 2009, he spoke in Prague's Hradcany Square. He did so duplicitously. He lied saying &quot;clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace &lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136784-2013-06-21-obamas-nuclear-arms-reduction-hoax.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

by Stephen Lendman
Obama's unwelcome in Berlin. He's not wanted. Many Berliners aren't pleased he came. His rhetoric fell short. Doublespeak duplicity is hollow. It doesn't sell well.
On July 29, 2008, 200,000 Germans cheered him. They did so in central Berlin's Tiergarten. They hoped he'd change Bush/Cheney policies. 
He promised. He lied. He exceeds the worst of his predecessors. On June 19, Obama chose the Brandenburg Gate. It was hermetically sealed off to protect him. 
He spoke behind thick bullet-proof glass. About 4,000 got to attend. They were handpicked to avoid embarrassment. More on his speech below. It wasn't an &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; moment.
Kennedy's visit was eagerly awaited. Around 120,000 massed to hear him. They did so on June 26, 1963. They cheered him in front of the Schoeneberg Rathaus (City Hall).
He came to support West Germany. Observers called his speech one of his best. It was a notable Cold War moment. It was a high point of his New Fron&lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136783-2013-06-20-obamas-berlin-moment.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

			<title>How to Avoid the Pitfalls of Variable Annuities</title>

On top of that, there are currently $2-3 trillion in annuities already in force. With all the variations, options, riders and strategies available, it's easy to feel lost. At Money Forever, we aim to simplify complex financial topics. To that end I'm going to share a case that jumped out at me as we researched our special report on annuities. The evaluation process used here translates to any sort of annuity you may encounter; its information you can keep in your back pocket and draw on when annuity salespeople try to overcomplicate products and make predictions sound like guarantees.

In this article I'll tackle what could be the most misunderstood flavor: the variable annuity. Let's start with a story about our friend Erik.
Variable Annuities
Erik's friends bought into the idea of buying their own pension with an annuity. They had taken large payouts from their employer and had put it all into annuities. This was back when &lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136763-2013-06-20-how-to-avoid-the-pitfalls-of-variable-annuities.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

EMERGENCY!!! ACTION ALERT!!!!! Share Widely!!!!

Barbara Bratton, a
 member of the LA Anti-Eviction Campaign, RHEMA,, and Occupy fights
Foreclosure, is being held hostage, on false charges, by the Ontario
police department, and the San Bernadino Sheriffs!!

Sister Barbara has worked tirelessly to help people enforce their
human right to housing. In waging her own battle for her home, she
identified the fraud recorded at the county recorders office by the
investor trying to steal her, and her mothers home. When she presented
this evidence to Sgt. Brian Hurst of the OPD, and tried to file a
criminal complaint, she was refused, and told that it was a civil, not a
 criminal matter.&amp;nbsp;

This refusal by Sgt. Hurst to even review the evidence she presented
 led to sister Barbara filing a complaint on him, as well as the judge
who refused to hear the evidence in her home defense.&amp;nbsp;

Her
complaint was refused, &lt;br&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.FreedomsPhoenix.com/Article/136756-2013-06-20-california-homeowner-activist-jailed-w-bail-set-at-250k.htm?EdNo=001&amp;amp;From=RSS&quot;&gt;Read More or Make a Comment&lt;/a&gt;</description>

by Stephen Lendman

Spying on its citizenry reflects one of the most defining police state characteristics. Post-9/11, America crossed the line.

Unconstitutional mass surveillance became official US policy. Bush began it. Obama accelerated it. He did so straightaway as president. 
He promised otherwise. He pledged transparency and openness. He promised no more Bush/Cheney lawlessness. He lied. He exceeded the worst of his predecessors.

Free societies don't tolerate these practices. Obama authorized them secretly. He subverted constitutional law. He violated the public trust. He broke a key campaign pledge.

He declared war on freedom. It's more illusion than reality. It's fast disappearing. It may entirely vanish on Obama's watch. Big Brother is real. It's no longer fiction. Privacy no longer exists.
