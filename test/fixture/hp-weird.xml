        &lt;p&gt;PETALUMA, Calif. -- A huge-headed, duck-footed mix of beagle, boxer and basset hound was the upset winner at the 25th annual World's Ugliest Dog Contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walle (WAHL-ee), a 4-year-old mutt from Chico, Calif., who was entered at the last minute, was judged Friday as the most unsightly of 30 dogs at the Northern California competition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"This dog looked like he's been photo-shopped with pieces from various dogs and maybe a few other animals," judge Brian Sobel said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walle overcame the dominance in recent years by nearly hairless Chihuahuas, Chinese cresteds, or combinations of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owner Tammie Barbee got the dog when he was three months old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"People come up to me and say that dog is not right," Barbee said, "but I love him."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judges said they were especially impressed by Walle's bizarre waddle of a walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walle wins $1,500 and will make several network TV appearances next week, including NBC's "Today" show and ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest at the Sonoma-Marin Fairgrounds gets worldwide attention, with media from around the world traveling to Petaluma, about 40 miles north of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizers say the dogs are judged for their "natural ugliness in both pedigree and mutt classes."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You really can't make this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reports, a Times Square panhandler holding a "I Need Money for Weed" sign, also known as the area's&lt;a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/06/22/times_square_weed_man_arrested_afte.php" target="_hplink"&gt; "weed" man, was arrested&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/weed-man-arrested-for-stabbing-beer-man-alien-predat-541892583" target="_hplink"&gt;stabbing Times Square's "beer" man&lt;/a&gt;, who carries a similar sign reading "I Need Beer." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an altercation Friday night, the two &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/weed-guy-stabs-beer-guy-times-square-article-1.1379660" target="_hplink"&gt;Times Square regulars started arguing&lt;/a&gt; on 42nd Street near 7th Avenue where the attack took place, The New York Daily News reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/184298/man-arrested-after-argument-between-panhandlers-leads-to-alleged-assault-in-times-square" target="_hplink"&gt;"beer" man, Wayne Semancik&lt;/a&gt;, told NY1 that the argument was over territory in the New York City locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When you spit in my face, darling, I'm going to hit you. I don't care who you are, how big you are, I'm going to hit you," Semancik told the New York news channel. "So the man, he pulled out a pen because I was hitting him, and he started stabbing me in the face, and I have five stab wounds in my face right now."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "weed" man in question is likely &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/nyregion/beggar-seeking-money-for-marijuana-wins-a-victory-in-court.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Joshua Long&lt;/a&gt; since he's &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/photosbyaniket/5223431671/" target="_hplink"&gt;well known for his infamous sign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in a photo posted on The Daily News' site, two other characters in the area, &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/weed-guy-stabs-beer-guy-times-square-article-1.1379660" target="_hplink"&gt;Alien and Predator, were questioned&lt;/a&gt; as bystanders by police after the debacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument is the latest in a series of &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/25/elmo-impostor-kicked-out-_n_1623837.html" target="_hplink"&gt;unusual incidents that involve costumed characters&lt;/a&gt; in the tourist-heavy area. In April, a man wearing a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/osvaldo-quiroz-lopez-cookie-monster-times-square-arrested_n_3037550.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Cookie Monster costume was arrested&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly shoving a 2-year-old whose mother apparently refused to tip the cartoon character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities have not stated what charges, if any, have been filed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/dogs/" target="_hplink"&gt;two-year-old Doberman&lt;/a&gt; recently gave birth to an incredible litter of 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gina was only expected to birth half a dozen puppies, with only three likely to survive. But, at five weeks old, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2343924/Gina-Doberman-said-vets-pregnant-pups-stuns-owner-giving-birth-litter-13-sell-1-000-each.html" target="_hplink"&gt;all 13  puppies are doing well&lt;/a&gt;. Owners Mark and Olga Holcomb named the pups after several &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/extreme-weather/" target="_hplink"&gt;extreme weather&lt;/a&gt; events, like Tempest, Zephyr, Hale, Blizzard, Aurora, and Storm, according to the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="gina the doberman" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1200003/thumbs/o-GINA-THE-DOBERMAN-900.jpg?5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The couple already sold seven of the dogs for about $1,550 each, but plan to keep one at home with them in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a companion of your own and are ready for the responsibility, take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.aspca.org/adoption/" target="_hplink"&gt;ASPCA adoption site&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.petfinder.com/" target="_hplink"&gt;Petfinder.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Wildlife officials are in the process of translocating 15 "rogue" elephants between protected breeding grounds in Kenya this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animals are being moved from the &lt;a href="http://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/wildlife_conservation/elephants" target="_hplink"&gt;Ol Pejeta Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; to Meru National Park after "&lt;a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201306191608.html" target="_hplink"&gt;terrorizing residents&lt;/a&gt;," damaging crops and destroying fences in the area, according to a report from &lt;a href="http://www.the-star.co.ke/" target="_hplink"&gt;The Star&lt;/a&gt;, a Kenyan newspaper. An official with the park said the relocation process is normal and carried out whenever populations surge to help control human-wildlife conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, elephants and their tusks are still prime targets for poachers, and more than &lt;a href="http://elephantleague.org/the-ivory-curse/" target="_hplink"&gt;40,000 are killed every year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Elephant Advocacy League. Fences and national park designations do little to deter &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/10/central-african-republic-elephants-dzanga-ndoki_n_3255935.html" target="_hplink"&gt;heavily armed raiders&lt;/a&gt; looking to profit off ivory that can sell for more than &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/world/asia/an-illicit-trail-of-african-ivory-to-china.html?pagewanted=all" target="_hplink"&gt;$1,300 a pound overseas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Some of these images may be slightly disturbing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/">
        &lt;p&gt;A Tennessee state official reportedly told residents who were concerned about dirty drinking water that &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/21/official-says-water-complaints-act-of-terrorism/2445071/" target="_hplink"&gt;complaining about water quality could be considered "an act of terrorism."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial comment was made by &lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/2013/06/21/tenn-official-warns-residents-that-water-quality-complaints-could-be-seen-as-terrorism/" target="_hplink"&gt;Sherwin Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy director of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's (TDEC) Division Of Water Resources, during a May 29 meeting organized by Tennessee state Rep. Sheila Butt (R-Columbia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You need to make sure that when you make water quality complaints you have basis," Smith said, according to audio obtained by &lt;a href="http://socm.org/index.cfm/m/54/fuseAction/contentPage.main/detailID/371" target="_hplink"&gt;Statewide Organizing For Community eMpowerment (SOCM)&lt;/a&gt;, a Knoxville-based civic action group. "Because federally, if there's no water quality issues, that can be considered, under Homeland Security, an act of terrorism." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments came during a discussion over poor water quality in Tennessee's Maury County, where residents have said &lt;a href="http://socm.org/index.cfm/m/54/fuseAction/contentPage.main/detailID/371" target="_hplink"&gt;people have gotten sick from drinking the water&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, the town of Mt. Pleasant, Tenn. &lt;a href="http://www.wkrn.com/story/20605649/mt-pleasant-issues-boil-water-notice" target="_hplink"&gt;issued a "boil water" notice to residents&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href="http://columbiadailyherald.com/sections/news/local-news/residents-told-boil-water.html" target="_hplink"&gt;health risks posed by bacteria in the water&lt;/a&gt;, Bobby Nutt, the town's public works director, told The Columbia Daily Herald at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meg Lockhart, a spokeswoman for the state environmental agency, said &lt;a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20130621/NEWS02/306210110/Official-Water-complaints-could-act-terrorism-?nclick_check=1" target="_hplink"&gt;it was looking into Smith's comments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The department would like to fully assess what was said in the meeting. I am told that the meeting was far longer than the audio clip provided by SOCM and that Mr. Smith actually clarified his remarks. But again, we are looking into it,” Lockhart said, according to The Tennessean. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As written in the Code of Laws of the United States, terrorism is "&lt;a href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t21t25+2679+1++%28politically%20motivated%20violence%29" target="_hplink"&gt;premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(H/t &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/21/official-says-water-complaints-act-of-terrorism/2445071/" target="_hplink"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1gseu4/official_complaining_about_tap_water_quality_in/" target="_hplink"&gt;iamstandingbehindyou on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;BANF, Alberta -- A Canadian man says he was chased by a gray wolf while he was riding a motorcycle in British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Bartlett of Banff tells the National Post (&lt;a href='http://bit.ly/8f5Yph'&gt;http://bit.ly/8f5Yph&lt;/a&gt;) the wolf darted onto the roadway and began chasing him June 8 as he was riding through the Canadian Rockies. The animal got within several feet (meters) of him before Bartlett accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After Bartlett put some distance between himself and the wolf, he stopped to take some photos, capturing it in full pursuit. He says he could hear the wolf's feet on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says he believes the wolf was after his bike. Bartlett accelerated again as traffic picked up, and he says he last saw the wolf running away from the highway and into the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;WE'RE SO SORRY, LIL BUB!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We forgot your birthday! For those readers unacquainted with &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/07/lil-bub_n_1656204.html" target="_hplink"&gt;the pinnacle of adorability, Lil Bub&lt;/a&gt; -- who turned 2 yesterday -- is a perma-kitten, meaning she'll have kitten-like features for her whole life. She also has absurdly huge eyes, a ridiculous tongue, and a great attitude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bub has been an Internet sensation ever since her special brand of cuteness captured the world's heart last year. &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/iamlilbub" target="_hplink"&gt;Her Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; has more than 100,000 likes, she's &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/13/lil-bub-and-friendz-vice-documentary-sundance_n_2866778.html" target="_hplink"&gt;starred in a movie&lt;/a&gt;, and she even gave HuffPost an &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/20/lil-bub-gives-interview-about-tard-grumpy-cat_n_2167130.html" target="_hplink"&gt;exclusive interview about her feelings&lt;/a&gt; regarding Internet cat rival, Tard the Grumpy Cat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAtMh03rkT0" target="_hplink"&gt;Lil Bub's YouTube account&lt;/a&gt;, she'll soon be getting her own web series, "Lil Bub's Big Show."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We honestly can't believe we forgot her birthday. There's no excuse, but we hope the dwarf cat will accept our belated b-day kisses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No word on &lt;a href="http://cdn.meme.li/instances/300x300/31450273.jpg" target="_hplink"&gt;whether Tard sent a gift.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;GETTYSBURG, Pa. -- The commander of the Confederate army marched to the front of the makeshift classroom in jeans and a dress blue shirt to deliver battle plans to his top lieutenants, complete with a PowerPoint presentation and laser pointer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen. Robert E. Lee would have been proud, if not perplexed, in seeing how Brian Gesuero took charge of the preparations for recreating the Battle of Gettysburg.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This year's commemoration has even more significance, given that it's the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, and Gettysburg will represent the pinnacle of the re-enactment careers of thousands of Civil War buffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This will be special, different than the other ones. It's the turning point of the war," said Gesuero, 44, a firefighter from Federalsburg, Md. "This is our one chance to do it right."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the 150th anniversary of Gettysburg is so big that it's getting two separate re-enactments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group called the Blue-Gray Alliance expects more than 10,000 re-enactors to take part in its event, June 28-30. This group has also held large-scale re-enactments, in honor of the Civil War's 150th anniversary, at Vicksburg, Shiloh, Twin Rivers and Wilson's Mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Park Service official events start June 30. The battle was fought July 1-3, 1863, at locations that have become legendary to war buffs, like Devil's Den, the Wheatfield and Little Round Top. Gettysburg was the bloodiest conflict of the Civil War, with more than 51,000 casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the re-enactments themselves occur on private property, not the actual battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gettysburg Anniversary Committee has more than 10,000 participants registered for the second gathering on July 4-7 on fields at the Redding Farm north of town. It's the group to which Gesuero, along with federal counterpart Allen Baldwin, methodically presented re-enactment preparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groups had discussed holding just one re-enactment, similar to the 135th anniversary in 1998. Back then, two events were eventually combined into one large battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not this time around. The topic's touchy to all sides, but essentially the groups couldn't reconcile differences over how to run the events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal commander for the Blue-Gray Alliance event, Bob Minton, said his group is proud to have secured the Bushey Farm, the site of the 135th anniversary re-enactment. That piece of land contains a long sloping ridge that resembles the battleground for Pickett's Charge, the famous confrontation on the final day of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It really gave us an opportunity for a wonderful piece of ground," said Minton, a Fostoria, Ohio, resident who works for an electrical supply company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride is also evident in the voices of members of the Gettysburg Anniversary Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jake Jeanette, of Swansboro, N.C., was assigned the distinction of depicting Confederate Gen. Lewis Armistead, who fixed his hat to the point of his sword in leading his brigade before being mortally wounded at a spot considered the Confederacy's northernmost advance in the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If we can pull these things off ... it's going to be something to remember," said Jeanette, wearing a gray hat with a yellow "CS" insignia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the competitive edge and political squabbles &amp;ndash; much like many other hobby groups &amp;ndash; are genuinely affable feelings. Members of each group wish the others well and share the same goals of educating the public and commemorating the bloody skirmish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The re-enactors are mainly a friendly, chatty bunch, eager to indoctrinate anyone curious about the hobby &amp;ndash; especially for the 150th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Janson is traveling all the way from Chiloquin, Ore., as captain of a group that portrays Hurt's Battery, light artillery from Alabama during the Civil War. But this re-enacting crew is based on the West Coast, and it's lugging two cannons and three horses with them, too, to take part in both Gettysburg events this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I figured driving that far, we might as well do as much as we can," said Janson, a retired teacher who will turn 66 while at Gettysburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janson said he has no emotional or political allegiance to the Confederacy any more than he does to the Union. He's simply fascinated about the period and the complex nature of the war and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I admit it, I'm just a big kid and I love making big noises with cannons," he said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for him, re-enacting is more than just about faux battles. He especially enjoys the interactions with visitors to the re-enactor camps &amp;ndash; and yes, the participants will stay in tents, too, as the real soldiers did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Just to get people to think that (the war) was way more complicated than what people believed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minton, the federal commander, started getting involved around the time that the 1993 movie "Gettysburg" was released. The film, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Killer Angels," by Michael Shaara, inspired many others like Minton to get involved, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minton looks forward to the camaraderie built up around campfires at night, exchanging stories and ideas about the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We all have different areas that interest us. What an incredible learning tool," he said. "If you picture talking to these people constantly, it just grows into real, good friendships ... It really makes an event almost a reunion."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One in which most participants are wearing wool clothing, anyway, to match the authentic uniforms of the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patrick Davis, 57, of West Chester, will serve as one of the top Confederate officers under Gesuero in the second re-enactment, overseeing camps. The purpose of re-enacting, he said, is to help ensure others don't forget what happened 150 years ago at the crossroads town in south-central Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's the one everyone wants to do. I mean, Gettysburg is the most studied battle in the history of the world," Davis said. "It's kind of the Holy Grail for re-enactors."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If You Go...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two re-enactments will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War's Battle of Gettysburg in Gettysburg, Pa. Each re-enactment group expects more than 10,000 participants at their events, with war buffs donning wool uniforms and bearing weapons &amp;ndash; firing blanks &amp;ndash; appropriate for the time. Living history and educational presentations, along with bands playing period music, are also on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The re-enactments will take place on private properties on the weekends bookending the actual July 1-3 battle anniversary. Official events at Gettysburg National Military Park begin June 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue-Gray Alliance re-enactment: More than 10,000 Civil War buffs are expected to gather for the first of the two battle re-enactments, which an organizer boasts is "like no others of its size and scale. It is by re-enactors for re-enactors."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEN: June 28-30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHERE: Bushey Farm, 1845 Pumping Station Road, Gettysburg, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TICKETS: $10 for one day, $20 for two days. Children 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult but do not need tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gettysburg Anniversary Committee re-enactment: The organization said it had more than 10,000 participants registered by early June and expected 135 cannon and about 400 horses for an event in which "those dusty old history books will come alive."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHEN: July 4-7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHERE: Redding Farm, 1085 Table Rock Road, Gettysburg, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TICKETS: In advance tickets range from $35 for one day to $90 for all four days for those 13 and older; $15 to $40 for children 6 to 12, children 5 and younger free. Grandstand seating $15 to $60. Prices higher at the gate.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One woman made the grave decision to get behind the wheel while three times the legal blood alcohol limit for driving and ended up in a shockingly much graver place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a 0.24 blood alcohol level, the woman "allegedly"* crashed her car into a graveyard containing the remains of her beloved mob-affiliated boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman, alleged to be driving a 2001 Chrysler Sebring, left her car hanging precariously over a fresh yet open grave in the Moravian Cemetery in the New Dorp neighborhood of New York's famous Staten Island. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deceased boyfriend, Frank Fresca, was murdered in 2008 and his death is allegedly tied to his cooperation with the FBI in regard to another murder. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Tired of missing in-flight snacks because you're snoozing? Luckily, an inventor has thought of a quirky solution...two actually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of his first eye mask (sans white board), Jason Lichtman, CEO and founder of Eclipse Products LLC, told HuffPost Travel via email: "As a frequent traveler, I struggled to fall asleep and then stay asleep on flights, just as most people do. I wasn't impressed with traditional sleep masks as they let a lot of light in where the mask crosses your nose. I set out to design my ideal sleep mask for traveling. I made and tested many prototypes at home as well as in the air. I knew I was on the right track as I started to fall asleep earlier into each flight and then stay asleep much longer. I got to the point where I was often asleep before takeoff and could stay asleep through the majority of an average domestic flight." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mask is made of foam and fleece and has eye cutouts that helps reduce the smudging of makeup--bonus: it allows for rapid eye movement so you can get deeper sleep while traveling. The shade's adjustable strap has storage for ear plugs to boot. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
As for his whiteboard eye mask, the idea came to him on a cross-country flight. Lichtman claims he was already asleep, but woke up thirsty, but he'd missed the beverage service. "I thought to myself that if I had only printed 'Please wake up for beverage service' on the mask, I would have been able to wake up to a cold cup of orange juice. The flight attendant would have seen my message and woken me up when he or she pulled up to my row with the beverage cart. Simple as that. That was my 'ah hah' moment."&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Lichtman hopes to sell the eye mask, made of foam and fleece, at airport kiosks, in in-flight magazines and &lt;a href="http://www.bestsleepingmask.com/" target="_hplink"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; (the total eclipse is being sold for $19.99, the whiteboard is being sold for $24.99). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the question remains...Would you buy it and actually wear this during a flight?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON -- Signature cocktails, small plates, wild game and faux taxidermy: that's how we honor Teddy Roosevelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the success of &lt;a href="http://lincolnrestaurant-dc.com/" target="_hplink"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, another president-themed eatery is about to open in the nation's capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take a sneak peak into Teddy &amp; The Bully Bar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--304274--HH&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in Dupont Circle, Teddy &amp; The Bully Bar features Rough Riders-inspired lighting fixtures, mounted animal skulls, paintings of the president by artist Maggie O'Neill and a rotating &lt;a href="http://teddyandthebullybar.net/bar/" target="_hplink"&gt;drink menu featuring themed cocktails like the Rough Rider Daiquiri and the Roosevelt Island Punch Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="teddy bar" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1205632/thumbs/r-TEDDY-BAR-403xFBcredit.jpg?6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you'd like some oddball football with your presidential appreciation, the the 8400 square-foot restaurant features &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/wp/2013/06/17/chris-cooleys-tribute-to-teddy-roosevelt/?wpisrc=nl_eats" target="_hplink"&gt;mugs, pots and jugs created by former Redskins tight end Chris Cooley&lt;/a&gt;. The decorative pieces are, sadly, not for sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Teddy touch: animal trophies. Teddy Roosevelt was, famously, &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/toddvanluling/teddy-roosevelt-hunting-endangered-animals" target="_hplink"&gt;a hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Paying tribute, kind of, Teddy &amp; The Bully Bar's main dining room features (faux) taxidermy. The private dining rooms feature some actual animal skulls. A warthog, cape buffalo and scimitar oryx are on display. According to a sign in the room, the animals were not killed by humans, but were found and preserved as art pieces. We're not sure what Teddy would think of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://teddyandthebullybar.net/" target="_hplink"&gt;Teddy &amp; Bully Bar&lt;/a&gt; opens to the public on Monday, June 24.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Jon Gosselin was on VH1's "The Gossip Table" earlier today (June 21), when he revealed that he is now living in the woods to stay off the grid. He doesn't currently have an address, so people/paparazzi can't get to him anymore. Gosselin just re-entered the news earlier this week, as the fashion brand Ed Hardy &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/ed-hardy-jon-gosselin_n_3458685.html" target="_hplink"&gt;blamed their collapse&lt;/a&gt; and bankruptcy on him wearing their shirts on "Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "living in the woods" part comes around 2:50.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Some people are into dogs, others cats, but Melanie Typaldos is what you would call a "capybara person."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A capybara is the largest species of rodent in the world, about the size of a dog. and Melanie and her husband, Richard Loveman, share their home in Buda, Tex. with Gary, who weighs 112 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Although some people might find it strange, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/weirdnewsvideo/10134979/Meet-Gary-the-worlds-largest-pet-rodent.html" target="_hplink"&gt;it’s really no different than having a dog or a cat. &lt;/a&gt;Gary is really very smart and he’s very affectionate," Typaldos, 57, said according to the Telegraph. "He learns tricks very quickly -- faster than your typical dog would. He knows how to shake, how to turn in a circle, how to stand up on his hind legs and how to jump up on things on command."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typaldos and Loveman, 54, fell in love with the South American rodents while vacationing in Venezuela and later found one from a breeder in Arkansas. Since &lt;a href="http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/world-news/worlds-largest-rodent-family-pet-1974587" target="_hplink"&gt;capybaras spend most of their time in the water,&lt;/a&gt; the couple added an above-ground pool for Gary and introduced him to their other pets, including a horse, a dog, a cat, rabbits and tortoises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He gets on well with the other animals, although he likes to chase the rabbits for fun," Typaldos said, according to the Irish Mirror. "He does sometimes get angry with the tortoises because he thinks they invade his space and there is nothing he can do about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life isn't all work and no play for the giant guinea pig. Typaldos takes him to local schools to educate children about capybaras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while she is definitely happy to sing his praises, Typaldos said the species isn't the perfect pet for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/weird-news/worlds-largest-rodent-family-pet-1974587" target="_hplink"&gt;"Capybaras can be quite aggressive&lt;/a&gt; sometimes and their teeth are very, very sharp. Gary is not at all aggressive, but a capybara bite can be pretty serious." she said, the DailyRecord.co.uk reported. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You are a Google Street View employee who is paid to &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/google-reveals-an-image-capturing-backpack-and-new-3d-maps/" target="_hplink"&gt;wear one of these&lt;/a&gt; on your back and walk around Japan. Your life is sweet. One day, you see these &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=35.704074,139.55773200000002&amp;cbp=,287.76,,1,20.010002&amp;layer=c&amp;panoid=gT28ssf0BB2LxZ63JNcL1w&amp;spn=0.18000000000000788,0.30000000000000676&amp;output=classic&amp;cbll=35.704074,139.557732" target="_hplink"&gt;awesome people wearing pigeon head masks&lt;/a&gt; on a Tokyo sidewalk. Your life gets exponentially sweeter, because -- despite whether this scene was set up or not -- you're about to embed an Easter egg in a utility for all the Web to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="japan google street view" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1205394/thumbs/o-JAPAN-GOOGLE-STREET-VIEW-900.jpg?6" /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Google Maps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You document the scene, then wait. On June 21, someone on Reddit &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gsar9/google_map_street_view_in_japan/" target="_hplink"&gt;pulls up the coordinates and cashes in the karma&lt;/a&gt;. The stunt draws favorable comparisons to &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/birdswitharms" target="_hplink"&gt;/r/birdswitharms&lt;/a&gt;. Your badassery goes viral. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this screen grab is pretty great, playing around with the actual view is even better. Users can see the pigeonheads from &lt;a href="http://i.imgur.com/Nqr9pkb.jpg" target="_hplink"&gt;different angles&lt;/a&gt;, including several clicks away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slate ran an image of the Pigeonheads last Friday but &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/06/14/google_street_view_gets_surreal_captures_people_dressed_as_pigeons_in_japan.html" target="_hplink"&gt;didn't really know what to make of it&lt;/a&gt;. "Were they on their way to some obscure Tokyo pigeon festival?" wrote staff writer Will Oremus.&lt;/p&gt;
