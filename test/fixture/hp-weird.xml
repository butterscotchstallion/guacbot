        &lt;p&gt;JAMISON CITY, Pa. -- Four central Pennsylvania residents said they used only a rope and a flashlight during a wild chase to rescue a young bear whose head had been stuck in a plastic jar for at least 11 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frightened but powerful bruin fell into a swimming pool at least twice during the ordeal, according to a report Saturday in the Press Enterprise of Bloomsburg (&lt;a href='http://bit.ly/166z97k'&gt;http://bit.ly/166z97k&lt;/a&gt;). But the group eventually yanked off the jar and set the animal free.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"I thought, `No one is going to believe us,'" said Morgan Laskowski, 22, the bartender at the Jamison City Hotel and a member of the impromptu bear-wrangling team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Area residents first spotted the 100-pound bruin with its head in a red jar on June 3, but it eluded game wardens. The animal was attracted to the container because it appeared to have once contained cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He put his head in, and had a problem," said Mike Jurbala, 68, another rescuer. "He'd have died in a couple more days."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jurbala saw the bear Thursday night as he was leaving the bar at the Jamison City Hotel. He called Jeff Hubler, a local employee of the state Game Commission who had been among those trying to capture it for days with a lasso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two teamed up with Laskowski and her mother, bar owner Jody Boyle, to follow the bear through the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You knew where he was because you could hear him banging into things," Jurbala said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They cornered the bear in a resident's backyard, where it ended up falling into a pool a couple of times. Eventually, they wrangled the animal into a position where Hubler could pull off the jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You'd think the bear would be weak, because it hadn't eaten or drunk for a week, but it was strong," Boyle said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hubler said people should keep lids on food jars that they throw away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium welcomed an &lt;a href="http://www.columbuszoo.org/news_room/press_releases/gorilla_born_to_first_time_parents.aspx" target="_hplink"&gt;adorable newborn gorilla&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little guy, who's technically a Western Lowland Gorilla, was born to first-time parents Kambera and Oliver on May 23. He's since been &lt;a href="http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2013/06/boy-of-boy-baby-gorilla-born-at-columbus-zoo.html" target="_hplink"&gt;raised by animal care experts&lt;/a&gt; at the zoo after his mother didn't show maternal instinct, Zooborns reports, but caretakers have let the pair spend a lot of time together and plan to try and reunite them soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's pretty cute, and the zoo recently released this darling image of him yawning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story continues below with additional photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="baby gorilla" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1187995/thumbs/o-BABY-GORILLA-900.jpg?6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9404/0" target="_hplink"&gt;Western Lowland Gorilla&lt;/a&gt; has been listed as critically endangered by the IUCN since 2007. They tend to live about 30 years in the wild, but can live up to their mid-50s in captivity, according to Zooborns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at more photos of the wide-eyed newborn below.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A Vancouver strip club that recruited award-winning chef Stuart Irving to revamp its less-than-mouth-watering menu earlier this year says food sales have more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The No. 5 Orange debuted Irving's new kitchen program on March 4, and less than four months later the Gastown gentleman's club appears to have reversed the long-standing stigma about strip club cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We'll take "Things That Make You Crack Up" for a 1000 points, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer: This video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game show contestants are put on the spot, so it's no surprise when a wacky or downright unbelievable moment happens.  What could be better than a compilation of the funniest game show answers? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This YouTube video  &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1gbh72/funniest_game_show_answers_of_all_time/" target="_hplink"&gt;resurfaced on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; Friday and promises a full 15-minutes of laughter, if you're looking for a pick-me-up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It combines the classic game shows -- from Family Feud to Newlyweds to Wheel of Fortune -- and gives you moments like, "Name a time that most people get up." "Morning." &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Anyone can be a father, but it takes a special person to be a bad dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a sprinkle of narcissism, a dash of bullheadedness and three scoops of a blatant disregard for the conventional rules of propriety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After combing our extensive files, HuffPost Weird News has found a few fathers who, if the allegations and accusations are correct, will never be candidates for father of any year (unless the award is given ironically).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Antonius Hart, Sr., who set a good example for his son, Antonius Hart Jr. when they didn't get the chicken wings they ordered at a Memphis fast food chain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two drove back and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/antonius-hart-fast-food-hold-up_n_3102190.html" target="_hplink"&gt;waved an AK-47 rifle at the employees&lt;/a&gt; who forgot the order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is strength in numbers, then surely Orlando Shaw is a great dad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee man has&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/orlando-shaw-father-22-children-14-women_n_3397397.html" target="_hplink"&gt; 22 children by 14 women&lt;/a&gt; and is being sued in what might be one of Nashville's most bizarre child support cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Shaw said he loves all of his kids and considers himself a good father. It's just that he can't afford to pay child support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;GALLERY: BAD DADS (Story continues below)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--302954--HH&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anthony Michael Hedger, 24, was arrested earlier this year by the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office and charged with unlawful neglect of a child after cops saw him walking naked with his baby boy -- also nude -- along the highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/anthony-michael-hedger-arrested_n_3039740.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Hedger allegedly bit his child when deputies attempted to take the naked kid into custody.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, Jaron McGee, 23, was accused of steering his 9-year-old daughter in the wrong direction &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/20/jaron-mcgee-arrested-afte_n_3307571.html" target="_hplink"&gt;by giving her driving lessons.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She ended up losing control and slamming the car into a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carron Washington, 20, didn't abandon his two-year-old daughter, but that may have been a better option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He allegedly &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/carron-washington-baby-bleach-congestion_n_2725187.html" target="_hplink"&gt;fed her bleach because he thought it would help her congestion. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police say Arthur Langley, 20, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/arthur-langley-rob-homes_n_1957353.html" target="_hplink"&gt;left his 1-year-old daughter home alone&lt;/a&gt; while he tried to break into neighbors' houses in a Philadelphia suburb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might have been better if Dario Napolitano had left his son alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was arrested last June for &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/02/dario-napolitano_n_1644252.html" target="_hplink"&gt;allegedly kicking his 3-year-old son in the face&lt;/a&gt; while at Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florida has another bad dad candidate in Elton Jerome Davis Jr., who allegedly abandoned his 18-month-old child in his home to go to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the police report, the accused &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/elton-davis-abandons-child-cheerios-florida_n_1535696.html" target="_hplink"&gt;left the toddler with a bowl of Cheerios&lt;/a&gt; and some orange juice to keep him company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unidentified witness later found the child playing with a dog on the side of a busy road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now it's your turn: Take a look at the gallery above and then vote for the man who you think is the worst dad ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/">
        &lt;p&gt;A deep-sea creature resembling a space alien more than an aquatic animal, photographed recently near the Canary Islands, was actually just a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/whales" target="_hplink"&gt;whale&lt;/a&gt; feeding on a school of fish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bizarre moment a &lt;a href="http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/nature/post/alien-like-creature-is-a-feeding-brydes-whale/" target="_hplink"&gt;Bryde's whale inflated itself into a gigantic orb&lt;/a&gt; after ingesting a whole school of bait sardines was captured on camera by photographer Eduardo Acevedo Fernandez, according to GrindTV. Fernandez posted a collection of the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.523414084382216.1073741825.100001408881758&amp;type=1" target="_hplink"&gt;amazing images to his Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, detailing how he and his companions thought the day would be a loss because the weather was not cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After two hours of navigation I spotted in the distance something like a hurricane of birds throwing themselves at the sea,” Fernandez wrote to GrindTV via email. “Quickly we headed to where we saw something amazing, hundreds of common and spotted dolphins attacking a big ball of sardines, along with three [Bryde's] whales. The idea was to capture the exact moment of the whale attack on the ball of sardines, but we knew it was very difficult because of her extreme speed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had mere seconds to capture the main event, the moment when the whale swelled into a giant balloon in order to consume the school of fish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www2.wdcs.org/species/species.php?sp=Balaenoptera_edeni" target="_hplink"&gt;Bryde's whale&lt;/a&gt; has between 40 and 70 pleats on its throat which expand while feeding, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. It mainly eats schooling fish but will sometimes feed on krill and other planktonic crustaceans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighing around 90,000 pounds and measuring between 40 and 55 feet, the Bryde's whale sometimes uses &lt;a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/brydeswhale.htm" target="_hplink"&gt;other methods of feeding&lt;/a&gt; in its natural tropical habitat, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These methods include skimming the surface, lunging and creating bubble nets. They can dive for five to 15 minutes and reach depths of around 1,000 feet. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A lost medieval city that thrived on a mist-shrouded Cambodian mountain 1,200 years ago has been discovered by archaeologists using revolutionary airborne laser technology, a report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what it called a world exclusive, the Sydney Morning Herald said the city, Mahendraparvata, included temples hidden by jungle for centuries, many of which have not been looted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A journalist and photographer from the newspaper accompanied the "Indiana Jones-style" expedition, led by a French-born archaeologist, through landmine-strewn jungle in the Siem Reap region where Angkor Wat, the largest Hindi temple complex in the world, is located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition used an instrument called Lidar -- light detection and ranging data -- which was strapped to a helicopter that criss-crossed a mountain north of Angkor Wat for seven days, providing data that matched years of ground research by archaeologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It effectively peeled away the jungle canopy using billions of laser pulses, allowing archaeologists to see structures that were in perfect squares, completing a map of the city which years of painstaking ground research had been unable to achieve, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helped reveal the city that reportedly founded the Angkor Empire in 802 AD, uncovering more than two dozen previously unrecorded temples and evidence of ancient canals, dykes and roads using satellite navigation coordinates gathered from the instrument's data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean-Baptiste Chevance, director of the Archaeology and Development Foundation in London who led the expedition, told the newspaper it was known from ancient scriptures that a great warrior, Jayavarman II, had a mountain capital, "but we didn't know how all the dots fitted, exactly how it all came together".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now know from the new data the city was for sure connected by roads, canals and dykes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery is set to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damian Evans, director of the University of Sydney's archaeological research centre in Cambodia, which played a key part in developing the Lidar technology, said there might be important implications for today's society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see from the imagery that the landscape was completely devoid of vegetation," Evans, a co-expedition leader, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One theory we are looking at is that the severe environmental impact of deforestation and the dependence on water management led to the demise of the civilisation ... perhaps it became too successful to the point of becoming unmanageable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Herald said the trek to the ruins involved traversing rutted goat tracks and knee-deep bogs after travelling high into the mountains on motorbikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved was sworn to secrecy until the findings were peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans said it was not known how large Mahendraparvata was because the search had so far only covered a limited area, with more funds needed to broaden it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe what we see was not the central part of the city, so there is a lot of work to be done to discover the extent of this civilisation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to preserve the area because it's the origin of our culture," secretary of state at Cambodia's Ministry of Culture, Chuch Phoeun, told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angkor Wat was at one time the largest pre-industrial city in the world, and is considered one of the ancient wonders of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was constructed from the early to mid 1100s by King Suryavarman II at the height of the Khmer Empire's political and military power.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Have apples, carrots, lemons or watermelon on your grocery list? &lt;a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/sharethebuzz" target="_hplink"&gt;Bad news -- without bees&lt;/a&gt;, these foods could be much harder to find in the produce section, according to a new campaign from Whole Foods Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/bees" target="_hplink"&gt;Bees&lt;/a&gt; are still having a rough time. The British Beekeepers Association said &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/13/honeybee-colonies-england-winter" target="_hplink"&gt;more than a third of colonies died&lt;/a&gt; in England this past winter, and U.S. populations suffered similar drops. Researchers have said an industry practice of &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/us-bee-deaths-colony-collapse_n_3379506.html?utm_hp_ref=bees" target="_hplink"&gt;feeding bees corn syrup&lt;/a&gt; may spur colony collapse disorder, which could affect the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/06/honey-bees-dying-food-disaster_n_3225599.html?utm_hp_ref=bees" target="_hplink"&gt;$30 billion crop industry&lt;/a&gt; dependent on bee pollination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe instituted a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/neonicotinoid-pesticide-ban-eu_n_3177612.html" target="_hplink"&gt;temporary ban on a class of pesticides believed to be harmful to bees&lt;/a&gt; in April, and researchers at Washington State University have proposed a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/13/bee-sperm-bank_n_3435794.html?utm_hp_ref=bees" target="_hplink"&gt;bee sperm bank&lt;/a&gt; to try and breed hardier colonies, but the insects are still dying in record numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would a &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/this-is-what-your-grocery-store-looks-like-without-bees-211164141.html#prettyPhoto" target="_hplink"&gt;supermarket without bees&lt;/a&gt; look like? Whole Foods pulled all of the produce dependent on pollinators from the shelves of their University Heights store in Rhode Island -- a whopping 237 items, or 52 percent of the normal product mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a peek below.&lt;br /&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/">
        &lt;p&gt;Police say a man in Charleston, Ill., ordered a lush meal -- complete with appetizers, steak and lobster and drinks --  at a restaurant, and then refused to pay the $70 bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Anthony M. Malabehar has been &lt;a href="http://jg-tc.com/news/man-gets-years-in-prison-after-restaurant-meal-thefts/article_1f604b9c-d3db-11e2-aa5f-0019bb2963f4.html?comment_form=true" target="_hplink"&gt;sentenced to three years in jail. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malabehar, 47, plead guilty to stealing from the restaurant on April 4, less than a month after pleading guilty to stealing from a different local restaurant, the Journal Gazette &amp; Times-Courier reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Schmink, Alamo Steak House's general manager, told CNN that in the most recent incident, when Malabehar's server asked him to pay the bill, he said &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/13/us/illinois-meal-bill-jail/index.html" target="_hplink"&gt;"I need to tell you a secret. I don't have any money."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He ordered a filet, snow crab, lobster pinches, snickers pie, two shots of rumple minz, and a Mike's hard lemonade," a spokeswoman for Alamo Steak House told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schmink then called the police, who &lt;a href="https://www.vinelink.com/vinelink/detailsAction.do?siteId=14004&amp;agency=29&amp;id=20130060&amp;searchType=offender" target="_hplink"&gt;brought Malabehar to Coles County jail&lt;/a&gt; just one day after he'd finished serving a 60-day sentence for the first incident. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though thefts of that amount are usually misdemeanors, Malabehar was charged with a felony because of his criminal history. According to CNN, his record includes 13 convictions for theft or burglary and about 70 arrests for theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 47-year-old never offered an explanation for why he repeatedly refused to pay restaurant tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;NEWARK, N.J. -- Some New Jersey bus commuters apparently have gotten an unexpected tour of the New York metro area they'd rather forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Jersey Transit is investigating why a trip that normally takes about 45 minutes took nearly two hours more Thursday when the driver took a circuitous route into Manhattan's Port Authority bus terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A passenger on the ill-fated trip tells Newark's The Star-Ledger newspaper (&lt;a href='http://bit.ly/162JhxE'&gt;http://bit.ly/162JhxE&lt;/a&gt;) the driver seemed lost and passed the Secaucus (sih-KAW'-kuhs) train station several times, drove past outlet stores and eventually crossed the George Washington Bridge. Normally, the bus would go through the Lincoln Tunnel, several miles south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aileen Iosso tells the newspaper when passengers asked to be let off after the driver passed the bus terminal the driver yelled at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;First it was restaurants. Then weddings. Dogs are being invited to more places (despite people ruining the party with &lt;a href="http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/service-dogs" target="_hplink"&gt;fake service dogs&lt;/a&gt;). What's next? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Church!" you might be thinking. "What about church? Are dogs allowed in church, hot-shot?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More From Dogster:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/how-far-would-you-go-stolen-dog-german-shorthaired-pointer-reward" target="_hplink"&gt;How Far Would You Go to Find Your Stolen Dog?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/dognapping-tricia-o-kelley-yorkie-dog-returned-unharmed" target="_hplink"&gt;Walter the Yorkie, Actress Tricia O'Kelley's Dog, Is Returned Unharmed After Being Dognapped&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.dogster.com/the-scoop/dogs-recruited-by-mlb-to-throw-out-first-pitches" target="_hplink"&gt;Major League Baseball Is Recruiting Dogs to Throw Out the First Pitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes they are! At least if you attend Wesley United Methodist Church in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. (You do, don't you?) At the 9 a.m. service, dogs are allowed to worship with the parishioners, or at least just quietly relax, according to a story by &lt;a href="http://www.sheboyganpress.com/article/20130605/SHE0101/306050511/The-Gospel-Bark-Church-unleashes-dog-friendly-services-video-photos-" target="_hplink"&gt;Sheboyganpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank the Rev. Ann Bullis for the unusual service -- and those bold parishioners who made the request in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“About two months ago (some congregants) came up to me and said, ‘Boy, I wish I could bring my pet to church. Can we bring our pets to church?’” Bullis told &lt;a href="http://www.sheboyganpress.com/article/20130605/SHE0101/306050511/The-Gospel-Bark-Church-unleashes-dog-friendly-services-video-photos-" target="_hplink"&gt;Sheboyganpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. “And we said, ‘Why not?’ We couldn’t come up with a reason why not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story continues after photo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="wisconsin church allows dogs" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1193115/thumbs/o-WISCONSIN-CHURCH-ALLOWS-DOGS-570.jpg?15" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dogs go to heaven,” Bullis added. “What would (heaven) be without our dogs? Heaven is supposed to be a happy place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The congregation was game, and thus far, a handful of people have elected to bring their dogs. People including Louise Hansen, 62, who regularly brings her husband and her two &lt;a href="http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Bichon_Frise" target="_hplink"&gt;Bichon Frises&lt;/a&gt;, Libby and Dolly, to services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re very much a part of my life and I consider them family members,” Hansen said. “They’re a real blessing, and God truly cares about animals. ... I always refer back to Noah and God saving his family and the animals from the flood. And I always feel that animals reflect the unconditional love that God has for his children.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todd Hueppchen, 49, brings his &lt;a href="http://www.dogster.com/dog-breeds/Golden_Retriever" target="_hplink"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, Diego. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From what I’ve seen from the two times I’ve been there, it tends to bring smiles to people’s faces,” Hueppchen said. “The majority of the people, they all like to see him, and (Diego) loves being around people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this policy won't work at every church. It needs a open, casual atmosphere -- especially with the potential for barking and accidents -- and that's exactly what Bullis is gunning for. In the past few years, the church has made it a goal to be more open and welcoming. Coffee, too, is permitted at church.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re just more casual. We’re not formal at all,” Bullis said. “I think it just goes with today’s society. People just like to roll out of bed and not put a lot of effort into dressing up. We’re just more of a family atmosphere. I can preach over kids and I can preach over dogs. It doesn’t bother me in the least.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen, pastor. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;PITTSBURGH -- A 73-year-old man and his grandson have been arrested in a Pittsburgh drug raid after police say they found heroin bricks, drug packaging material and guns in a search of their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police say they raided the home Friday morning after a three-month investigation by plainclothes officers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They arrested Albert Martin and his 20-year-old grandson, Troy Martin. They say both will face drug charges, while the younger Martin also will face weapons charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A woman answering the phone at the Martin home says the men didn't do anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police say they found 24 bricks of heroin worth $12,000 and an ounce of cocaine worth $1,000. They also say they found two pistols with a 30-round magazine and $4,220 in cash.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sy Perlis, a 91-year-old weightlifter, bench-pressed 187.2 pounds last week to &lt;a href="http://www.azcentral.com/community/surprise/articles/20130614world-champion.html" target="_hplink"&gt;break the world record&lt;/a&gt; in the 90-and-over age division, the Arizona Republic reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the idea of a nonagenarian lifting more than what many grown men weigh is enough to amaze, consider this: The Surprise, Ariz., man hoisted 52.2 pounds more than the previous mark set in the World Association of Benchers and Deadlifters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crain.ws/about_us.html#RickeyDaleCrainBiography" target="_hplink"&gt;"I would say that's pretty phenomenal,"&lt;/a&gt; five-time world powerlifting champion Rickey Dale Crain told The Huffington Post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch above as Perlis wows the crowd at the National Push-Pull Bench Press and Dead Lift Championships June 8 in Phoenix by slowly lowering the barbell to his chest and pushing the weight all the way up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perlis, a World War II veteran, owes his Herculean strength to five workouts a week after he skipped competition in 2012 to have a pacemaker inserted, the Republic wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Association of Benchers and Deadlifters says on its website that &lt;a href="http://www.wabdl.org/" target="_hplink"&gt;drug-testing takes place at every meet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perlis has certainly earned our respect, as well as his place alongside names of other amazing senior citizens who excel at feats of endurance. Take Fauja Singh, who recently retired as the so-called &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/02/25/worlds-oldest-marathoner-retires-at-101/" target="_hplink"&gt;"world's oldest marathoner."&lt;/a&gt; He was 101.&lt;/p&gt;
