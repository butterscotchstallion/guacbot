"Throughout history, nations have used encryption to protect their secrets, and today, terrorists, cybercriminals, human traffickers and others also use code to hide their activities. Our intelligence community would not be doing its job if we did not try to counter that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the specifics of how our intelligence agencies carry out this cryptanalytic mission have been kept secret, the fact that NSA's mission includes deciphering enciphered communications is not a secret, and is not news. Indeed, NSA's public website states that its mission includes leading 'the US government in cryptology … in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stories published yesterday, however, reveal specific and classified details about how we conduct this critical intelligence activity. Anything that yesterday's disclosures add to the ongoing public debate is outweighed by the road map they give to our adversaries about the specific techniques we are using to try to intercept their communications in our attempts to keep America and our allies safe and to provide our leaders with the information they need to make difficult and critical national security decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy groups, however, said the NSA's activities were endangering privacy and putting both US internet users and businesses users at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even as the NSA demands more powers to invade our privacy in the name of cybersecurity, it is making the internet less secure and exposing us to criminal hacking, foreign espionage, and unlawful surveillance," &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-comment-nsa-effort-defeat-encryption-worldwide"&gt;said the ACLU's principal technologist&lt;/a&gt; Christopher Soghoian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The NSA's efforts to secretly defeat encryption are recklessly shortsighted and will further erode not only the United States' reputation as a global champion of civil liberties and privacy but the economic competitiveness of its largest companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/leaks-show-nsa-working-undermine-encrypted-communications-heres-how-you-can-fight"&gt;blogpost by Dan Auerbach and Eva Galperin&lt;/a&gt; of the Electronic Frontier Foundation dubbed the activities "frightening" and "an egregious violation of our privacy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the New York Times' public editor Margaret Sullivan &lt;a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/decision-to-publish-against-government-request-was-not-a-particularly-anguished-one/?ref=thepubliceditor&amp;_r=0"&gt;praised the collaboration&lt;/a&gt;, calling the organisations' reporting "an important story, published courageously". In the same post, she quoted the Times' executive editor Jill Abramson as noting "The Guardian at the beginning was highly concerned about working in a way that kept the material secure – we went to lengths to safeguard the material."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abramson said she had met with US officials who had asked her not to publish the story, but said the decision to publish alongside the Guardian was "not a particularly anguished one".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance"&gt;Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-computer-security"&gt;Data and computer security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection"&gt;Data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesball"&gt;James Ball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Welcome to the end of secrecy | Jeff Jarvis</title>
      <link>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/06/nsa-surveillance-welcome-end-secrecy</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.theguardian.com/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.5/99910?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Article%3Ansa-surveillance-welcome-end-secrecy%3A1961693&amp;ch=Comment+is+free&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=NSA%2CNSA+files%2CSurveillance+%28News%29%2CInternet%2CGoogle+%28Technology%29%2CMicrosoft+%28Technology%29%2CEmail+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CEdward+Snowden%2CObama+administration%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CPrivacy+%28News%29%2CMedia%2CPress+freedom+%28Media%29%2CUS+press+and+publishing%2CData+protection+%28Govt.%2Findustrial+use+of+data%29%2CData+and+computer+security+%28safeguarding+computers+and+data+from+criminals%29%2CUS+national+security+defence+defense%2CGCHQ+%28News%29&amp;c5=Press+Media%2CUnclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CMedia+Weekly%2CUS+Elections%2CTechnology+Gadgets%2CCorporate+IT%2CMarketing+Media&amp;c6=Jeff+Jarvis&amp;c7=2013%2F09%2F06+04%3A56&amp;c8=1961693&amp;c9=Blog&amp;c10=Comment&amp;c13=&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c25=Comment+is+free&amp;c47=UK&amp;c64=US&amp;c65=Welcome+to+the+end+of+secrecy&amp;c66=Comment+is+free&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FComment+is+free%2FComment+is+free%2Fblog%2FComment+is+free" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;The real lesson of the Snowden leaks is not the threat to privacy. It is the NSA's losing battle against the new agents of openness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that privacy is dead. &lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Anonymity-online.aspx"&gt;Not so&lt;/a&gt;. It's secrecy that is dying. Openness will kill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American and British spies undermined the secrecy and security of everyone using the internet with their efforts to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security"&gt;foil encryption&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Edward Snowden foiled them by revealing what is perhaps – though we may never know – their greatest secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I worried on Twitter that we could not trust encryption now, technologist Lauren Weinstein &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/laurenweinstein/status/375722641463595008"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; with assurances that it would be difficult to hide "backdoors" in commonly used &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"&gt;PGP encryption&lt;/a&gt; – because it is open-source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openness is the more powerful weapon. Openness is the principle that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-editorial-rusbridger"&gt;guides, for example, Guardian journalism&lt;/a&gt;. Openness is all that can restore trust &lt;a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2013/08/24/what-are-you-thinking-mr-president/"&gt;in government&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2013/08/09/nsa-post/"&gt;technology companies&lt;/a&gt;. And openness – in standards, governance, and ethics – must be the basis of technologists' efforts to &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/05/government-betrayed-internet-nsa-spying"&gt;take back the the net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secrecy is under dire threat but don't confuse that with privacy. "All human beings have three lives: public, private, and secret," Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/206413-all-human-beings-have-three-lives-public-private-and-secret"&gt;tells&lt;/a&gt; his biographer. "Secrecy is what is known, but not to everyone. Privacy is what allows us to keep what we know to ourselves," Jill Lepore &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/06/24/130624fa_fact_lepore"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; in the New Yorker. "Privacy is consensual where secrecy is not," &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1977.tb01881.x/abstract"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Carol Warren and Barbara Laslett in the Journal of Social Issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: privacy is what we keep to ourselves; secrecy is what is kept from us. Privacy is a &lt;a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; claimed by citizens. Secrecy is a privilege claimed by government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's often said that the internet is a threat to privacy, but on the whole, I argue it is not much more of a threat than a gossipy friend or a nosy neighbor, a slip of the tongue or of the email "send" button. Privacy is certainly put at risk when we can no longer trust that our communication, even encrypted, are safe from government's spying eyes. But privacy has many &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=privacy+advocates&amp;rlz=1CAZZAB_enUS550US550&amp;oq=privacy+adv&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l2.1473j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#psj=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=privacy+advocates&amp;tbm=nws"&gt;protectors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we all have one sure vault for privacy: our own thoughts. Even if the government were capable of mind-reading, ProPublica argues in an &lt;a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/why-we-published-the-decryption-story"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; explaining its reason to join the Snowden story, the fact of it "would have to be known".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agglomeration of data that makes us fear for our privacy is also what makes it possible for one doubting soul – one Manning or Snowden – to learn secrets. The speed of data that makes us fret over the the devaluation of facts is also what makes it possible for journalists' facts to spread before government can &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london"&gt;stop them&lt;/a&gt;. The essence of the Snowden story, then, isn't government's threat to privacy, so much as it is government's loss of secrecy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, it will take a great deal for government to learn that lesson. Its first response is to try to match a loss of secrecy with greater secrecy, with a war on the agents of openness: &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chelsea-manning"&gt;whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/05/obama_s_justice_department_holder_s_leak_investigations_are_outrageous_and.html"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters"&gt;news organizations&lt;/a&gt;. President Obama had the opportunity to meet Snowden's revelations – redacted responsibly by the Guardian – with embarrassment, apology, and a vow to make good on his &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment"&gt;promise of transparency&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/22/democrat-disgusted-with-president-obama1"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the agents of openness will continue to wage their war on secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/05/government-betrayed-internet-nsa-spying"&gt;powerful charge&lt;/a&gt; to fellow engineers, security expert Bruce Schneier urged them to fix the net that "some of us have helped to subvert." Individuals must make a moral choice, whether they will side with secrecy or openness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So must their companies. Google and Microsoft are &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/aug/31/microsoft-google-sue-us-fisa"&gt;suing&lt;/a&gt; government to be released from their secret restrictions – but there is still more they can say. I would like Google to explain what British agents could mean when they talk of "new access opportunities being developed" at the company. Google's &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/05/nsa-snowden-encryption-cracked/2772721/"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; – "we have no evidence of any such thing ever occurring" – would be more reassuring if it were more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest story demonstrates that the Guardian, now in partnership with the New York Times and ProPublica, as well as publications in &lt;a href="http://buzzmachine.com/2013/08/20/the-nsa-germany-and-journalism/"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and Brazil that have pursued their own surveillance stories, will continue to report openly in spite of government acts of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/05/guardian-assurances-government-reporting-miranda-greenwald"&gt;intimidation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am disappointed that more news organizations, especially in London, are not helping support the work of openness by adding reporting of their own and editorializing against government overreach. I am also saddened that my American colleagues in &lt;a href="http://www.naa.org/"&gt;news industry organizations&lt;/a&gt;, as well as journalism education groups, are not protesting loudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even without them, what this story teaches is that it takes only one technologist, one reporter, one news organization to defeat secrecy. At length, openness will out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance"&gt;Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/email"&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden"&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/press-freedom"&gt;Press freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/us-press-publishing"&gt;US press and publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection"&gt;Data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-computer-security"&gt;Data and computer security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq"&gt;GCHQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeffjarvis"&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

With that in mind, here are five ways to stay safe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/06/nsa-surveillance-revelations-encryption-expert-chat"&gt;Explaining the latest NSA revelations – Q&amp;A &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have enough details about how the NSA eavesdrops on the internet, including &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security"&gt;today's disclosures&lt;/a&gt; of the NSA's deliberate weakening of cryptographic systems, we can finally start to figure out how to protect ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past two weeks, I have been working with the Guardian on NSA stories, and have read hundreds of top-secret NSA documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. I wasn't part of today's story – it was in process well before I showed up – but everything I read confirms what the Guardian is reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I feel I can provide some advice for keeping secure against such an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary way the NSA eavesdrops on internet communications is in the network. That's where their capabilities best scale. They have invested in enormous programs to automatically collect and analyze network traffic.  Anything that requires them to attack individual endpoint computers is significantly more costly and risky for them, and they will do those things carefully and sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324108204579022874091732470.html"&gt;its&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/02/telecoms-bt-vodafone-cables-gchq"&gt;secret&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/agreements-with-private-companies-protect-us-access-to-cables-data-for-surveillance/2013/07/06/aa5d017a-df77-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_story.html"&gt;agreements&lt;/a&gt; with telecommunications companies – all the US and UK ones, and many other "partners" around the world – the NSA gets access to the communications trunks that move internet traffic. In cases where it doesn't have that sort of friendly access, it does its best to surreptitiously monitor communications channels: tapping undersea cables, intercepting satellite communications, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's an enormous amount of data, and the NSA has equivalently &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data"&gt;enormous capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to quickly sift through it all, looking for interesting traffic. "Interesting" can be defined in many ways: by the source, the destination, the content, the individuals involved, and so on. This data is funneled into the vast NSA system for future analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSA collects much more &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/nsa-data-mining-authorised-obama"&gt;metadata&lt;/a&gt; about internet traffic: who is talking to whom, when, how much, and by what mode of communication. Metadata is a lot easier to store and analyze than content. It can be extremely personal to the individual, and is enormously valuable intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Systems Intelligence Directorate is in charge of data collection, and the resources it devotes to this is staggering. I read status report after status report about these programs, discussing capabilities, operational details, planned upgrades, and so on. Each individual problem – recovering electronic signals from fiber, keeping up with the terabyte streams as they go by, filtering out the interesting stuff – has its own group dedicated to solving it. Its reach is global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSA also &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/nsa-router-hacking/"&gt;attacks network devices directly&lt;/a&gt;: routers, switches, firewalls, etc. Most of these devices have surveillance capabilities &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3924.txt"&gt;already built in&lt;/a&gt;; the trick is to surreptitiously turn them on. This is an especially fruitful avenue of attack; routers are updated less frequently, tend not to have security software installed on them, and are generally ignored as a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSA also devotes considerable resources to attacking endpoint computers. This kind of thing is done by its TAO – &lt;a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/06/10/inside_the_nsa_s_ultra_secret_china_hacking_group "&gt;Tailored Access Operations&lt;/a&gt; – group.  TAO has a menu of exploits it can serve up against your computer – whether you're running Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, or something else – and a variety of tricks to get them on to your computer. Your anti-virus software won't detect them, and you'd have trouble finding them even if you knew where to look. These are hacker tools designed by hackers with an essentially unlimited budget. What I took away from reading the Snowden documents was that if the NSA wants in to your computer, it's in. Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSA deals with any encrypted data it encounters more by subverting the underlying cryptography than by leveraging any secret mathematical breakthroughs. First, there's a lot of bad cryptography out there. If it finds an internet connection protected by MS-CHAP, for example, that's easy to break and recover the key. It exploits poorly chosen user passwords, using the same &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/a_really_good_a.html"&gt;dictionary attacks&lt;/a&gt; hackers use in the unclassified world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As was &lt;a href=""&gt;revealed today&lt;/a&gt;, the NSA also works with security product vendors to ensure that commercial encryption products are broken in secret ways that only it knows about. We know this has happened historically: &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/01/nsa_backdoors_i.html"&gt;CryptoAG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/2/2898/1.html"&gt;Lotus Notes&lt;/a&gt; are the most public examples, and there is evidence of a back door in &lt;a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/5/5263/1.html"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;. A few people have told me some recent stories about their experiences, and I plan to write about them soon. Basically, the NSA asks companies to subtly change their products in undetectable ways: making the random number generator less random, leaking the key somehow, adding a common exponent to a public-key exchange protocol, and so on. If the back door is discovered, it's explained away as a mistake. And as we now know, the NSA has enjoyed enormous success from this program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAO also hacks into computers to recover long-term keys. So if you're running a VPN that uses a complex shared secret to protect your data and the NSA decides it cares, it might try to steal that secret. This kind of thing is only done against high-value targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you communicate securely against such an adversary? Snowden &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/edward-snowden-nsa-files-whistleblower"&gt;said it&lt;/a&gt; in an online Q&amp;A soon after he made his first document public: "Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/09/black-budget-what-exactly-are-the-nsas-cryptanalytic-capabilities/"&gt; believe this is true&lt;/a&gt;, despite today's revelations and tantalizing hints of "&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/08/black-budget/"&gt;groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities&lt;/a&gt;" made by James Clapper, the director of national intelligence in another top-secret document. Those capabilities involve deliberately weakening the cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snowden's follow-on sentence is equally important: "Unfortunately, endpoint security is so terrifically weak that NSA can frequently find ways around it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endpoint means the software you're using, the computer you're using it on, and the local network you're using it in. If the NSA can modify the encryption algorithm or drop a Trojan on your computer, all the cryptography in the world doesn't matter at all. If you want to remain secure against the NSA, you need to do your best to ensure that the encryption can operate unimpeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this in mind, I have five pieces of advice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Hide in the network&lt;/strong&gt;. Implement hidden services. Use Tor to anonymize yourself. Yes, the NSA targets Tor users, but it's work for them. The less obvious you are, the safer you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Encrypt your communications&lt;/strong&gt;. Use TLS. Use IPsec. Again, while it's true that the NSA &lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/security/government/want-nsa-attention-use-encrypted-communi/240157089"&gt;targets encrypted connections&lt;/a&gt; – and it may have explicit exploits against these protocols – you're much better protected than if you communicate in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Assume that while your computer can be compromised, it would take work and risk on the part of the NSA – so it probably isn't&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have something really important, use an air gap. Since I started working with the Snowden documents, I bought a new computer that has &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; been connected to the internet. If I want to transfer a file, I encrypt the file on the secure computer and walk it over to my internet computer, using a USB stick. To decrypt something, I reverse the process. This might not be bulletproof, but it's pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Be suspicious of commercial encryption software, especially from large vendors&lt;/strong&gt;. My guess is that most encryption products from large US companies have NSA-friendly back doors, and many foreign ones probably do as well. It's prudent to assume that foreign products also have foreign-installed backdoors. Closed-source software is easier for the NSA to backdoor than open-source software. Systems relying on master secrets are vulnerable to the NSA, through either &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/how-might-the-feds-have-snooped-on-lavabit/"&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; or more clandestine means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Try to use public-domain encryption that has to be compatible with other implementations&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, it's harder for the NSA to backdoor TLS than BitLocker, because any vendor's TLS has to be compatible with every other vendor's TLS, while BitLocker only has to be compatible with itself, giving the NSA a lot more freedom to make changes. And because BitLocker is proprietary, it's far less likely those changes will be discovered. Prefer symmetric cryptography over public-key cryptography. Prefer conventional discrete-log-based systems over elliptic-curve systems; the latter have constants that the NSA influences when they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I started working with Snowden's documents, I have been using &lt;a href="http://www.gnupg.org/"&gt;GPG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://silentcircle.com/"&gt;Silent Circle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tails.boum.org/"&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/"&gt;OTR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/"&gt;TrueCrypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/"&gt;BleachBit&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other things I'm not going to write about.  There's an undocumented encryption feature in my &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/passsafe.html"&gt;Password Safe&lt;/a&gt; program  from the command line); I've been using that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that most of this is impossible for the typical internet user. Even I don't use all these tools for most everything I am working on. And I'm still primarily on Windows, unfortunately. Linux would be safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSA has turned the fabric of the internet into a vast surveillance platform, but they are not magical. They're limited by the same economic realities as the rest of us, and our best defense is to make surveillance of us as expensive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust the math. Encryption is your friend. Use it well, and do your best to ensure that nothing can compromise it. That's how you can remain secure even in the face of the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance"&gt;Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-computer-security"&gt;Data and computer security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection"&gt;Data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/bruceschneier"&gt;Bruce Schneier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They reveal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• A 10-year NSA program against encryption technologies made a breakthrough in 2010 which made "vast amounts" of data collected through internet cable taps newly "exploitable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The NSA spends $250m a year on a program which, among other goals, works with technology companies to "covertly influence" their product designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The secrecy of their capabilities against encryption is closely guarded, with analysts warned: "Do not ask about or speculate on sources or methods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The NSA describes strong decryption programs as the "price of admission for the US to maintain unrestricted access to and use of cyberspace".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• A GCHQ team has been working to develop ways into encrypted traffic on the "big four" service providers, named as Hotmail, Google, Yahoo and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies insist that the ability to defeat encryption is vital to their core missions of counter-terrorism and foreign intelligence gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But security experts accused them of attacking the internet itself and the privacy of all users. "Cryptography forms the basis for trust online," said Bruce Schneier, an encryption specialist and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. "By deliberately undermining online security in a short-sighted effort to eavesdrop, the NSA is undermining the very fabric of the internet." Classified briefings between the agencies celebrate their success at "defeating network security and privacy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the past decade, NSA has lead [sic] an aggressive, multi-pronged effort to break widely used internet encryption technologies," stated a 2010 GCHQ document. "Vast amounts of encrypted internet data which have up till now been discarded are now exploitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An internal agency memo noted that among British analysts shown a presentation on the NSA's progress: "Those not already briefed were gobsmacked!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough, which was not described in detail in the documents, meant the intelligence agencies were able to monitor "large amounts" of data flowing through the world's fibre-optic cables and break its encryption, despite assurances from internet company executives that this data was beyond the reach of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key component of the NSA's battle against encryption, its collaboration with technology companies, is detailed in the US intelligence community's top-secret 2013 budget request under the heading "Sigint [signals intelligence] enabling".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the program – $254.9m for this year – dwarfs that of the Prism program, which operates at a cost of $20m a year, according to previous NSA documents. Since 2011, the total spending on Sigint enabling has topped $800m. The program "actively engages US and foreign IT industries to covertly influence and/or overtly leverage their commercial products' designs", the document states. None of the companies involved in such partnerships are named; these details are guarded by still higher levels of classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other things, the program is designed to "insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems". These would be known to the NSA, but to no one else, including ordinary customers, who are tellingly referred to in the document as "adversaries".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These design changes make the systems in question exploitable through Sigint collection … with foreknowledge of the modification. To the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The document sets out in clear terms the program's broad aims, including making commercial encryption software "more tractable" to NSA attacks by "shaping" the worldwide marketplace and continuing efforts to break into the encryption used by the next generation of 4G phones.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Among the specific accomplishments for 2013, the NSA expects the program to obtain access to "data flowing through a hub for a major communications provider" and to a "major internet peer-to-peer voice and text communications system". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology companies maintain that they work with the intelligence agencies only when legally compelled to do so. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data"&gt;The Guardian has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft co-operated with the NSA to circumvent encryption on the Outlook.com email and chat services. The company insisted that it was obliged to comply with "existing or future lawful demands" when designing its products.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The documents show that the agency has already achieved another of the goals laid out in the budget request: to influence the international standards upon which encryption systems rely.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Independent security experts have long suspected that the NSA has been introducing weaknesses into security standards, a fact confirmed for the first time by another secret document. It shows the agency worked covertly to get its own version of a draft security standard issued by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology approved for worldwide use in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eventually, NSA became the sole editor," the document states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSA's codeword for its decryption program, Bullrun, is taken from a major battle of the American civil war. Its British counterpart, Edgehill, is named after the first major engagement of the English civil war, more than 200 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classification guide for NSA employees and contractors on Bullrun outlines in broad terms its goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Project Bullrun deals with NSA's abilities to defeat the encryption used in specific network communication technologies. Bullrun involves multiple sources, all of which are extremely sensitive." The document reveals that the agency has capabilities against widely used online protocols, such as HTTPS, voice-over-IP and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), used to protect online shopping and banking.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The document also shows that the NSA's Commercial Solutions Center, ostensibly the body through which technology companies can have their security products assessed and presented to prospective government buyers, has another, more clandestine role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used by the NSA to "to leverage sensitive, co-operative relationships with specific industry partners" to insert vulnerabilities into security products. Operatives were warned that this information must be kept top secret "at a minimum".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more general NSA classification guide reveals more detail on the agency's deep partnerships with industry, and its ability to modify products. It cautions analysts that two facts must remain top secret: that NSA makes modifications to commercial encryption software and devices "to make them exploitable", and that NSA "obtains cryptographic details of commercial cryptographic information security systems through industry relationships".&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The agencies have not yet cracked all encryption technologies, however, the documents suggest. Snowden appeared to confirm this during a live Q&amp;A with Guardian readers in June. "Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on," he said before warning that NSA can frequently find ways around it as a result of weak security on the computers at either end of the communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents are scattered with warnings over the importance of maintaining absolute secrecy around decryption capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strict guidelines were laid down at the GCHQ complex in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on how to discuss projects relating to decryption. Analysts were instructed: "Do not ask about or speculate on sources or methods underpinning Bullrun." This informaton was so closely guarded, according to one document, that even those with access to aspects of the program were warned: "There will be no 'need to know'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies were supposed to be "selective in which contractors are given exposure to this information", but it was ultimately seen by Snowden, one of 850,000 people in the US with top-secret clearance.A 2009 GCHQ document spells out the significant potential consequences of any leaks, including "damage to industry relationships".&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Loss of confidence in our ability to adhere to confidentiality agreements would lead to loss of access to proprietary information that can save time when developing new capability," intelligence workers were told. Somewhat less important to GCHQ was the public's trust which was marked as a moderate risk, the document stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some exploitable products are used by the general public; some exploitable weaknesses are well known eg possibility of recovering poorly chosen passwords," it said. "Knowledge that GCHQ exploits these products and the scale of our capability would raise public awareness generating unwelcome publicity for us and our political masters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decryption effort is particularly important to GCHQ. Its strategic advantage from its Tempora program – direct taps on transatlantic fibre-optic cables of major telecommunications corporations – was in danger of eroding as more and more big internet companies encrypted their traffic, responding to customer demands for guaranteed privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without attention, the 2010 GCHQ document warned, the UK's "Sigint utility will degrade as information flows changes, new applications are developed (and deployed) at pace and widespread encryption becomes more commonplace." Documents show that Edgehill's initial aim was to decode the encrypted traffic certified by three major (unnamed) internet companies and 30 types of Virtual Private Network (VPN) – used by businesses to provide secure remote access to their systems. By 2015, GCHQ hoped to have cracked the codes used by 15 major internet companies, and 300 VPNs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another program, codenamed Cheesy Name, was aimed at singling out encryption keys, known as 'certificates', that might be vulnerable to being cracked by GCHQ supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on the Edgehill project were working on ways into the networks of major webmail providers as part of the decryption project. A quarterly update from 2012 notes the project's team "continue to work on understanding" the big four communication providers, named in the document as Hotmail, Google, Yahoo and Facebook, adding "work has predominantly been focused this quarter on Google due to new access opportunities being developed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help secure an insider advantage, GCHQ also established a Humint Operations Team (HOT). Humint, short for "human intelligence" refers to information gleaned directly from sources or undercover agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This GCHQ team was, according to an internal document, "responsible for identifying, recruiting and running covert agents in the global telecommunications industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This enables GCHQ to tackle some of its most challenging targets," the report said. The efforts made by the NSA and GCHQ against encryption technologies may have negative consequences for all internet users, experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Backdoors are fundamentally in conflict with good security," said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. "Backdoors expose all users of a backdoored system, not just intelligence agency targets, to heightened risk of data compromise." This is because the insertion of backdoors in a software product, particularly those that can be used to obtain unencrypted user communications or data, significantly increases the difficulty of designing a secure product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a view echoed in &lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2262397"&gt;a recent paper by Stephanie Pell&lt;/a&gt;, a former prosecutor at the US Department of Justice and non-resident fellow at the Center for Internet and Security at Stanford Law School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[An] encrypted communications system with a lawful interception back door is far more likely to result in the catastrophic loss of communications confidentiality than a system that never has access to the unencrypted communications of its users," she states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence officials asked the Guardian, New York Times and ProPublica not to publish this article, saying that it might prompt foreign targets to switch to new forms of encryption or communications that would be harder to collect or read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three organisations removed some specific facts but decided to publish the story because of the value of a public debate about government actions that weaken the most powerful tools for protecting the privacy of internet users in the US and worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq"&gt;GCHQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance"&gt;Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection"&gt;Data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-computer-security"&gt;Data and computer security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger"&gt;Julian Borger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesball"&gt;James Ball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/glenn-greenwald"&gt;Glenn Greenwald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We engineers built the internet – and now we have to fix it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/06/nsa-surveillance-revelations-encryption-expert-chat"&gt;Explaining the latest NSA revelations – Q&amp;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government and industry have betrayed the internet, and us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By subverting the internet at every level to make it a vast, multi-layered and robust surveillance platform, the NSA has undermined a fundamental social contract. The companies that build and manage our internet infrastructure, the companies that create and sell us our hardware and software, or the companies that host our data: we can no longer trust them to be ethical internet stewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the internet the world needs, or the internet its creators envisioned. We need to take it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And by we, I mean the engineering community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is primarily a political problem, a policy matter that requires political intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is also an engineering problem, and there are several things engineers can – and should – do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One, we should expose. If you do not have a security clearance, and if you have not received a National Security Letter, you are not bound by a federal confidentially requirements or a gag order. If you have been contacted by the NSA to subvert a product or protocol, you need to come forward with your story. Your employer obligations don't cover illegal or unethical activity. If you work with classified data and are truly brave, expose what you know. &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-429.html"&gt;We need whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to know how exactly how the NSA and other agencies are subverting routers, switches, the internet backbone, encryption technologies and cloud systems. I already have five stories from people like you, and I've just started collecting. I want 50. There's safety in numbers, and this form of civil disobedience is the moral thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two, we can design. We need to figure out how to re-engineer the internet to prevent this kind of wholesale spying. We need new techniques to prevent communications intermediaries from leaking private information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can make surveillance expensive again. In particular, we need open protocols, open implementations, open systems – these will be harder for the NSA to subvert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet Engineering Task Force, the group that defines the standards that make the internet run, has a meeting planned for early November in Vancouver. This group needs to dedicate its next meeting to this task. This is an emergency, and demands an emergency response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three, we can influence governance. I have resisted saying this up to now, and I am saddened to say it, but the US has proved to be an unethical steward of the internet. The UK is no better. The NSA's actions are legitimizing the internet abuses by China, Russia, Iran and others. We need to figure out new means of internet governance, ones that makes it harder for powerful tech countries to monitor everything. For example, we need to demand &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/essay-435.html"&gt;transparency, oversight, and accountability&lt;/a&gt; from our governments and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is going play directly into the hands of totalitarian governments that want to control their country's internet for even more extreme forms of surveillance. We need to figure out how to prevent that, too. We need to avoid the mistakes of the International Telecommunications Union, which has become a forum to legitimize bad government behavior, and create truly international governance that can't be dominated or abused by any one country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generations from now, when people look back on these early decades of the internet, I hope they will not be disappointed in us. We can ensure that they don't only if each of us makes this a priority, and engages in the debate. We have a &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/Statement-by-Edward-Snowden-to.html"&gt;moral duty&lt;/a&gt; to do this, and we have no time to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dismantling the surveillance state won't be easy. Has any country that engaged in mass surveillance of its own citizens voluntarily given up that capability? Has any mass surveillance country avoided becoming totalitarian? Whatever happens, we're going to be breaking new ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the politics of this is a bigger task than the engineering, but the engineering is critical. We need to demand that real technologists be involved in any key government decision making on these issues. We've had enough of lawyers and politicians not fully understanding technology; we need technologists at the table when we build tech policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the engineers, I say this: we built the internet, and some of us have helped to subvert it. Now, those of us who love liberty have to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com"&gt;Bruce Schneier&lt;/a&gt; writes about security, technology, and people.

      <title>Americans fear hackers more than the government over online privacy</title>

In fact, they are more intent on trying to mask their personal information from hackers, advertisers, friends and family members than they are trying to avoid observation by the government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeper measures to protect privacy are still used by a relative niche of the US online population. Pew found that 14% of respondents had encrypted their communications online, while 14% had used a service that allowed them to browse the web anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are people worried about? 33% of people who'd taken measures to protect their privacy said they were trying to hide their activities from hackers or criminals, while 28% said they were concerned about advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19% said they were hiding from "people in their past" or "certain friends"; 17% from "people who might criticise, harass or target them"; 14% from family members or a romantic partner; and 11% from employers, supervisors or workmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, given the debates around anti-piracy legislation, only 6% of Pew's respondents said they were trying to avoid their online activity being observed by "companies or people who might want payment for files you download".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the government and law enforcement authorities were well down the list at 5% and 4% respectively. The survey was conducted between 11 July and 14 July, well after the first revelations about the US National Security Agency's surveillance activities broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Pew's respondents' online privacy measures were taken based on experience. 21% said they'd had an email or social networking profile "compromised or taken over" by someone else without permission, while 12% said they had been stalked or harassed online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11% said they'd had important personal information stolen like social security numbers, credit card or bank account details; 6% had fallen victim to an online scam and lost money; and 6% said they'd had their reputation damaged because of something that happened online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pew also found that 68% of internet users think current laws are not protecting their privacy enough online, while 50% are worried about the amount of personal information about them that's online – up from 33% in a similar survey in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to see teenagers as the generation least concerned by online privacy, but previous research from Pew has suggested this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey conducted last year found that &lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Where-Teens-Seek-Privacy-Advice/Summary-and-About.aspx"&gt;70% of 12-17 year-old Americans have sought outside advice&lt;/a&gt; about how to manage some aspect of online privacy, including 42% from friends or peers, and 41% from parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This applies to mobile apps too. A separate Pew study found that &lt;a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teens-and-Mobile-Apps-Privacy.aspx"&gt;51% of teenage app users have avoided certain apps&lt;/a&gt; due to privacy concerns, while 26% have uninstalled an app after learning it was collecting personal information that they didn't wish to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pew's are not the only studies finding increased concerns about online privacy. Internet security company AVG – yes, it has a vested interest here – released its own study of 4,927 people across eight countries yesterday too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that 46% of respondents said they have increased concerns about their privacy and a higher distrust of companies and their ability to protect people's personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also found that 69% of people felt technology would become more intrusive over the next five years, almost as many as the 72% who expect it to become more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend can also be seen in the growth for anonymous search engines like DuckDuckGo, which said in July that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/10/nsa-duckduckgo-gabriel-weinberg-prism"&gt;its traffic had spiked sharply after the NSA revelations&lt;/a&gt;, moving from serving 1.7m searches a day at the start of June to 3m a fortnight later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, research commissioned by civil liberties campaigner Big Brother Watch earlier this year, based on a ComRes survey of 10,354 people in nine countries, found that &lt;a href="http://www.bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/home/2013/06/new-research-global-attitudes-to-privacy-online.html"&gt;79% of respondents were concerned about their privacy online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/socialnetworking"&gt;Social networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/hacking"&gt;Hacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stuart-dredge"&gt;Stuart Dredge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The organisation is regularly criticised by the left as rightwing and berated for its unswerving opposition to reform of gun laws. But it carries a lot of weight with Congress, claiming five million members and being extremely well funded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACLU case is scheduled to be heard in a New York court but is likely to move up to higher courts, perhaps even the supreme court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also filing an amicus brief in support for the ACLU on Wednesday was the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. It argues the collection of data will seriously undermine the ability of journalists to protect sources. "The integrity of a confidential reporter-source relationship is critical to producing good journalism, and mass telephone call tracking compromises that relationship to the detriment of the public interest," it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wholesale government monitoring of telephone users leaves them uncertain of the privacy of their communications and thus unwilling to exchange information or participate in meaningful conversations. Amici are concerned that, if left unchecked, the mass call tracking at issue here will infringe on the newsgathering rights of journalists and harm the public interest in journalism of all types."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACLU, welcoming the support of the NRA and others, said: "The range of voices joining the protest against mass government surveillance – not to mention the bipartisan storm since the recent NSA disclosures – is a real testament to the fact that the government's dragnet surveillance practices are offensive to Americans from across the political spectrum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACLU case challenges the government's ongoing collection under section 215 of the Patriot Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance"&gt;Surveillance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties"&gt;US constitution and civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/civil-liberties-international"&gt;Civil liberties - international&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ewenmacaskill"&gt;Ewen MacAskill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <title>Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange: our new heroes | Slavoj Žižek</title>

It is our means of keeping 'public reason' alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all remember President Obama's smiling face, full of hope and trust, in his first campaign: &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/27/yeswecan" title=""&gt;"Yes, we can!"&lt;/a&gt; – we can get rid of the cynicism of the Bush era and bring justice and welfare to the American people. Now that the US continues its covert operations and expands its intelligence network, spying even on its allies, we can imagine protesters shouting at Obama: "How can you use drones for killing? How can you spy even on our allies?" Obama murmurs with a mockingly evil smile: "Yes, we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But simple personalisation misses the point: the threat to freedom disclosed by whistleblowers has deeper, systemic roots. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden" title=""&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt; should be defended not only because his acts annoyed and embarrassed US secret services; what he revealed is something that not only the US but also all great (and not so great) powers – from China to Russia, Germany to Israel – are doing (to the extent they are technologically able to do it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His acts provided a factual foundation to our suspicions of being monitored and controlled – their lesson is global, reaching far beyond the standard US-bashing. We didn't really learn from Snowden (or Manning) anything we didn't already presume to be true. But it is one thing to know it in general, another to get concrete data. It is a little like knowing that one's sexual partner is playing around – one can accept the abstract knowledge, but pain arises when one gets the steamy details, pictures of what they were doing …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 1843, the young &lt;a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm" title=""&gt;Karl Marx claimed&lt;/a&gt; that the German ancien regime "only imagines that it believes in itself and demands that the world should imagine the same thing". In such a situation, to put shame on those in power becomes a weapon. Or, as Marx goes on: "The actual pressure must be made more pressing by adding to it consciousness of pressure, the shame must be made more shameful by publicising it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, exactly, is our situation today: we are facing the shameless cynicism of the representatives of the existing global order, who only imagine that they believe in their ideas of democracy, human rights etc. What happens in WikiLeaks disclosures is that the shame – theirs, and ours for tolerating such power over us – is made more shameful by publicising it. What we should be ashamed of is the worldwide process of the gradual narrowing of the space for what &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/" title=""&gt;Kant&lt;/a&gt; called the "public use of reason".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his classic text, What Is Enlightenment?, Kant contrasts "public" and "private" use of reason – "private" is for Kant the communal-institutional order in which we dwell (our state, our nation …), while "public" is the transnational universality of the exercise of one's reason: "The public use of one's reason must always be free, and it alone can bring about enlightenment among men. The private use of one's reason, on the other hand, may often be very narrowly restricted without particularly hindering the progress of enlightenment. By public use of one's reason I understand the use that a person makes of it as a scholar before the reading public. Private use I call that which one may make of it in a particular civil post or office which is entrusted to him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see where Kant parts with our liberal common sense: the domain of state is "private" constrained by particular interests, while individuals reflecting on general issues use reason in a "public" way. This Kantian distinction is especially pertinent with internet and other new media torn between their free "public use" and their growing "private" control. In our era of cloud computing, we no longer need strong individual computers: software and information are provided on demand; users can access web-based tools or applications through browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wonderful new world is, however, only one side of the story. Users are accessing programs and software files that are kept far away in climate-controlled rooms with thousands of computers – or, to quote a propaganda-text on cloud computing: "Details are abstracted from consumers, who no longer have need for expertise in, or control over, the technology infrastructure 'in the cloud' that supports them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are two telltale words: abstraction and control. To manage a cloud there needs to be a monitoring system that controls its functioning, and this system is by definition hidden from users. The more the small item (smartphone) I hold in my hand is personalised, easy to use, "transparent" in its functioning, the more the entire setup has to rely on the work being done elsewhere, in a vast circuit of machines that co-ordinate the user's experience. The more our experience is non-alienated, spontaneous, transparent, the more it is regulated by the invisible network controlled by state agencies and large private companies that follow their secret agendas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we choose to follow the path of state secrets, we sooner or later reach the fateful point at which the legal regulations prescribing what is secret become secret. Kant formulated the basic axiom of the public law: "All actions relating to the right of other men are unjust if their maxim is not consistent with publicity." A secret law, a law unknown to its subjects, legitimises the arbitrary despotism of those who exercise it, as indicated in the title of a recent report on China: "Even what's secret is a secret in China." Troublesome intellectuals who report on political oppression, ecological catastrophes, rural poverty etc, got years in prison for betraying a state secret, and the catch was that many of the laws and regulations that made up the state-secret regime were themselves classified, making it difficult for individuals to know how and when they are in violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the all-encompassing control of our lives so dangerous is not that we lose our privacy, that all our intimate secrets are exposed to Big Brother. There is no state agency able to exert such control – not because they don't know enough, but because they know too much. The sheer size of data is too large, and in spite of all intricate programs for detecting suspicious messages, computers that register billions of data are too stupid to interpret and evaluate them properly, ridiculous mistakes where innocent bystanders are listed as potential terrorists occur necessarily – and this makes state control of communications even more dangerous. Without knowing why, without doing anything illegal, we can all be listed as potential terrorists. Recall the legendary answer of a Hearst newspaper editor to Hearst's inquiry as to why he doesn't want to take a long-deserved holiday: "I am afraid that if I go, there will be chaos, everything will fall apart – but I am even more afraid to discover that if I go, things will just go on as normal without me, a proof that I am not really needed!" Something similar can be said about the state control of our communications: we should fear that we have no secrets, that secret state agencies know everything, but we should fear even more that they fail in this endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why whistleblowers play a crucial role in keeping the "public reason" alive. Assange, Manning, Snowden, these are our new heroes, exemplary cases of the new ethics that befits our era of digitalised control. They are no longer just whistleblowers who denounce the illegal practices of private companies to the public authorities; they denounce these public authorities themselves when they engage in "private use of reason".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need Mannings and Snowdens in China, in Russia, everywhere. There are states much more oppressive than the US – just imagine what would have happened to someone like Manning in a Russian or Chinese court (in all probability no public trial). However, one should not exaggerate the softness of the US: true, the US doesn't treat prisoners as brutally as China or Russia – because of its technological priority, it simply does not need the brutal approach (which it is more than ready to apply when needed). In this sense, the US is even more dangerous than China insofar as its measures of control are not perceived as such, while Chinese brutality is openly displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not enough to play one state against the other (like Snowden, who used Russia against the US): we need a new international network to organise the protection of whistleblowers and the dissemination of their message. Whistleblowers are our heroes because they prove that if those in power can do it, we can also do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden"&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chelsea-manning"&gt;Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks"&gt;WikiLeaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection"&gt;Data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/slavojzizek"&gt;Slavoj Žižek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Pirate party is committed to turning this around&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every week, we hear more bad news about the danger to democracy brought by uncontrollable secret services spying on millions of citizens. And every week, more people realise how grave this cyber-attack on civil rights is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate triggered by the recent NSA and GCHQ spy scandal forces governments to take a stand – in one way or another. How they act will be judged by us – the citizens of each nation in Europe and the rest of the world. The &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters" title=""&gt;UK government is currently testing its limits with its outrageous assault against the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, after disclosure of its shameful "I spy for you, you spy for me" policy. The British government turned against its people, against core democratic values and everybody could see it. But the German government is so far also failing to take a clear stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany assumes a very specific role in this conflict, turning out to be &lt;a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/nsa-spies-on-500-million-german-data-connections-a-908648.html" title=""&gt;the most surveilled country in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, spied upon just as much as Saudi Arabia or China. But Germany is also the nation with perhaps the highest respect for data protection worldwide. In Germany, we learned the hard way how dangerous data collections about people are. My parents saw how in one lifetime a society can switch values from one extreme to the other, with two dictatorships using all the data its helpers could get hold of to oppress its own people. I saw one of these dictatorships close-up, growing up in East Germany. Why would we not be suspicious? If not against our current government, than against governments to come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is because of this dark past that not only are Germany's data protection laws stricter than elsewhere but also freedom rights are still held high. Intelligence officers forcing the destruction of source material at a media institution would lead to unthinkable outrage in Germany and, likely, a minister stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But among the blind, the one-eyed man is king. In the last decade, Germany too has started using totalitarian methods. Many laws have been passed to ease surveillance – most of them while Angela Merkel was chancellor. Nearly one in every four of them were then scrapped by our highest court for being unconstitutional. Even the lax barriers of spy-friendly laws are regularly being ignored by public agencies. And still, we  feel like a nation with the highest standards of privacy rights although, in fact, we have ceased to be one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the feeling and the high estimation of privacy is still vivid and this can now be used to reset the course, back to democracy, where we, the people, define checks and balances and the degree of transparency we want. It is no accident that the Pirate party has seats in four German state parliaments and realistic prospects to enter the national parliament in September. This young political force represents the digital society, fighting for transparent governments and citizen empowerment as well as for freedom rights and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany's special situation, combined with its economic and political power, comes as an opportunity and as an obligation. We must kick off a global surveillance disarmament movement just like the nuclear disarmament decades ago. While the world has so far succeeded in preventing a nuclear world war, we find ourselves on the verge of a globalised totalitarian system, with more repressive potential than has been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushed by Germany, this surveillance disarmament could start within the EU, with basic rights such as freedom of the press reinstalled and an end to spying on citizens. We, as a union of 28 countries, could become the core of a new value system for the global digital society. Together, we can take back our sovereignty and tell the US that we are no longer their allies in a war that is no longer a war on terrorism but on the people. The German federal election will be also be a vote on whether we want this change to happen or prefer to wait until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This piece was commissioned after a suggestion from &lt;a href="http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/26355713" title=""&gt;JTzara&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>The next David Miranda might work for the Daily Mail</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.theguardian.com/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.5/41028?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Article%3Adavid-miranda-guardian-broadsheet-tabloid-press%3A1955163&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=Obs&amp;c4=David+Miranda%2CPress+regulation%2CNSA+files%2CNSA%2CThe+Guardian+%28Media%29%2CNational+newspapers+UK+%28media%29%2CNewspapers%2CData+protection+%28Govt.%2Findustrial+use+of+data%29%2CWorld+news%2CPress+and+publishing%2CMedia&amp;c5=Press+Media%2CUnclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CMedia+Weekly%2CTechnology+Gadgets&amp;c6=Peter+Preston&amp;c7=2013%2F08%2F24+09%3A03&amp;c8=1955163&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Comment&amp;c13=Peter+Preston+on+press+and+broadcasting+%28series%29&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c47=UK&amp;c64=UK&amp;c65=The+next+David+Miranda+might+work+for+the+Daily+Mail&amp;c66=News&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FNews%2FWorld+news%2FDavid+Miranda" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Recent developments show dangers of press infighting – but also that public interest defences must extend to tabloids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British mouse didn't roar. Indeed, it barely squeaked. But consider: the partner of – and courier for – a &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; journalist &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/glenn-greenwald-guardian-partner-detained-heathrow" title=""&gt;held for nearly nine hours in transit at Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;, his computer and memory sticks seized under a section of the Terrorism Act that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/david-miranda-law-detention-heathrow" title=""&gt;even the lawyers who drafted it don't think fits&lt;/a&gt;. The editor of the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; obliged to stand idly by as&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london" title=""&gt; two top men from GCHQ demand computer hard drives smashed in his paper's basement&lt;/a&gt;. You don't get press freedom issues more starkly defined than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cpj.org/" title=""&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt; in New York sees the threat. So do Index on Censorship, Liberty and all the campaigning rest. The Council of Europe and Barack Obama both recoil from the methods employed. Welcome to pariah state status (renewed). If wrecking those computers was a "symbolic" act, as editor Alan Rusbridger says, then the symbolism is truly terrible. Yet our own press, so vocal in defending its liberties when royal charters and cold pizza are on the table, has seemed split and petty and muffled when put to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I believe – well, I would, wouldn't I? – that the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; is fighting this surveillance fight with calm and skill: that those, in the name of democracy, who seek to smother its efforts under a blanket of intimidation are betraying themselves as well as us. But it's worth pausing along the way for a second and seeing how one battle goes with another, and perhaps why this damned mouse has been such a paltry disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Gerard, a vibrant media blogger, &lt;a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/content/fleet-street-may-not-care-about-guardian-it-should-care-about-attacks-individual-and-press" title=""&gt;lays it on the line&lt;/a&gt;. Because "whistleblowing, leaking, what you will, is not an activity that is of intrinsic interest to readers", she writes. Because "the Miranda story has been treated as almost just another episode in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian's&lt;/em&gt; personal drama". Because "it's an easy way to get at the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, the unloved team member, the holier-than-thou paper that brought Leveson and all its horrors raining down on us". So the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Express &lt;/em&gt;and co. are excused boots (but allowed acrid commentary just offstage when more &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; journalists are scooped up in the Met's Operation Elveden net).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, there's another sort of warfare here as Fleet Street's big battalions seek to get their Independent Press Standards Organisation (successor to the Press Complaints Commission) up and running – and the pesky &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; stands aside in lonely disapproval. One awkward-squad thing goes with another. And it is also perhaps time to note how, even day by day, such things move rapidly on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rusbridger's resourceful defences of his position have themselves developed since the Snowden story broke and began a hot summer in Washington DC. For instance, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters" title=""&gt;Rusbridger now declares&lt;/a&gt;: "David Miranda's professional status – with much hand-wringing about whether or not he's a proper 'journalist' – is largely irrelevant in these circumstances. Increasingly, the question about who deserves protection should be less 'is this a journalist?' than 'is the publication of this material in the public interest?'." Ends, not means. And thus, when the hard disks were ceremonially crunched, nothing substantive happened in the editor's view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bluntly, we did not have to do our reporting out of London. Already, most of the National Security Agency stories were being reported and edited out of New York … We will continue to do patient, painstaking reporting on the Snowden documents, we just won't do it in London." Pragmatic defiance, not subservience. &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/23/guardian-news-york-times-partnership" title=""&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; is signed up as nifty publishing partner.&lt;/a&gt; All the visiting cabinet secretaries and heavy mobs up from Cheltenham, all the legal threats of prior restraint, can't stop the march of digital exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a new era – and one where "total surveillance", when it comes, means "it may not be long before it will be impossible for journalists to have confidential sources … Those colleagues who denigrate Snowden or say reporters should trust the state to know best … may one day have a cruel awakening. One day it will be their reporting, their cause, under attack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet how does any of this fit with the thrust of Leveson and its incipient implementation? Answer: it doesn't. You may, if you wish, posit two separate regulatory-cum-legislative regimes: one designed to shelter investigations undertaken in "the public interest", however defined, the other aimed at the red-top press and its racy ways with personal privacy. But this, frankly, is to bay at the moon. Must every case involving the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; fall one side of the line and every case involving an upmarket journalist automatically drop into another category?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this touches legal reality. None of it responds to last week's predictably complex high court decision between "national security" and "criminal inquiry" over the use of Miranda's seized computer information – pending full hearings and fuller days in court for lawyers, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveson, remember, is the work of a very senior judge prescribing more work for senior judges (in arbitration, in verifying the purity of regulatory processes, in sanctifying the PCC's independent successor). The first name emerging from government circles as supreme arbiter of such sanctity was Lord (Simon) Brown – once president of the intelligence services tribunal and related matters. But, frankly, it beggars belief that any top retired judge, called "independently" to perform this kind of service, would take a much different view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law starts from one point, journalism from another. The law – in Leveson terms – wants long, winding audit trails involving so many lugubrious stamps of approval that even the BBC committee system would grow weak at the knees. It needs specific stories passing various hurdles of serious scrutiny on the road to publication, thousands of stolen disks that may or may not ever be deemed fit to print. It wants the issues to be decided in court neatly organised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, journalism, as Rusbridger says, is about what's there to be published, what editors think we need to know. Our law operates in one jurisdiction, England and Wales: other countries have quite different systems (see the US on privacy, for instance). Does that mean that something of great public interest can be investigated and then published by the same newspaper or website in one country and not in another because of prevailing self-regulatory undertakings? If so, shouldn't codes of conduct transcend national boundaries, too? But then, how do you do that if the laws that lie behind them, the imperatives they mirror, are often wholly different? How do you operate when, as here, the apparatus of the state is the enemy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a whole landscape of operation here that, frankly, Leveson never addressed. There's a whole dawn of cruel awakenings that the debate about self-regulation hasn't begun to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm always anxious about grand arguments that invoke the public interest only for one side of Fleet Street. (I thought Detective Inspector April Casburn of the Met was probably in good public interest territory when she rang up the &lt;em&gt;News of the World&lt;/em&gt; and said anti-terrorist inquiries were suffering because too many officers had been shifted to anti-hacking duty: but that's no consolation to her as she serves her 15 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difficulty now is that good journalism and the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; deserve every scrap of support they can muster, because the essence of their trade is at risk. But the difficulty beyond that is that such backing, with such good intentions, doesn't fall into one easy basket serving one particular audience. The next source to find himself banged up at Heathrow could belong to the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;Mirror.&lt;/em&gt; The next intermediary peddling stolen goods could go to the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; (in fact, the last one did go to the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;). The next case with something horrid happening in the digital basement could quite spoil Paul Dacre's day. The next reporter to find police knocking on the door could belong to the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Indy&lt;/em&gt; or – perish the thought – &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;. And maybe the last &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; reporter to be arrested made it seem more natural to arrest all reporters when required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an argument that splits both ways, then – and one that almost starts afresh as Leveson gathers dust. There may, in this new digital world of symbolic gestures and futilities, be no imposed regime that fits every bill. It may simply prove an impossible concept. We may all have to start with what's there to be published, not what we think ought to be published using only wholesome, genteel methods. Freedom in this infernally complex new wired world may use little boxes called computers, but it cannot live inside them. You can have freedom to squabble, argue and sneer: but not the freedom to bully and suppress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalists of all persuasions will certainly have to compromise and learn the essence of mutual respect. But think of the gains of broader basic unity in the end. Imagine a din that echoes through every airport transit lounge, every computer storage basement and every nook and cranny from Westminster to Cheltenham – not the silence of the damned out-of-hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/david-miranda"&gt;David Miranda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/press-regulation"&gt;Press regulation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/national-newspapers"&gt;National newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers"&gt;Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection"&gt;Data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Newspapers &amp; magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterpreston"&gt;Peter Preston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.theguardian.com/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.25.5/75495?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Article%3Adavid-miranda-rights-security%3A1955421&amp;ch=Comment+is+free&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=David+Miranda%2CCounter-terrorism+policy+%28UK+Politics%29%2CLaw%2CNSA%2CCounter-terrorism+and+security+%28UK+news%29%2CNSA+files%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CLiberal+Democrats+Lib+dems%2CNick+Clegg&amp;c5=Unclassified%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CUSA+HSBC&amp;c6=Nick+Clegg+%28contributor%29&amp;c7=2013%2F08%2F23+07%3A59&amp;c8=1955421&amp;c9=Blog&amp;c10=Comment&amp;c13=&amp;c19=GUK&amp;c25=Comment+is+free&amp;c47=UK&amp;c64=UK&amp;c65=I+share+the+concerns+about+David+Miranda%27s+detention&amp;c66=Comment+is+free&amp;c72=&amp;c73=&amp;c74=&amp;c75=&amp;h2=GU%2FComment+is+free%2FComment+is+free%2Fblog%2FComment+is+free" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Individual rights must not be cast aside in the name of security. If changes to the Terrorism Act are recommended, we will seek to implement them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events of last week &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/david-miranda" title=""&gt;involving the Guardian and its reporters&lt;/a&gt; have renewed debate and inflamed concern about the age-old dilemma of how to strike the balance between individual liberty and collective security. The coalition made freedom one of its founding principles back in 2010 and many people are looking to us now to prove we meant it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberal Democrats believe government must tread the fine line between liberty and security very carefully, and are not easily persuaded by a government minister asserting: "Just trust me." So now that we are in government, we have been vigilant in ensuring the right decisions are made: scrutinising and challenging the assumptions of security experts, even as we give them our wholehearted support in their aim to keep the public safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may remember the ferocious debate earlier this year between me and the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/25/snoopers-charter-nick-clegg-agreement" title=""&gt;Conservatives on plans to introduce a "snooper's charter"&lt;/a&gt;, keeping records of everyone's email and internet activity. We looked at the details time and again, and agreed to tackle the issue of how we track IP addresses, but the plan as a whole was a bridge too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One point on which both parties have been united is this: seeking to unpick the worst excesses of Labour's authoritarian legislation. From restoring rights to protest, ending the detention of children in immigration cases, scrapping ID cards and limiting some terrorism powers, we have turned the clock back on their biggest mistakes. It has been bizarre to see Yvette Cooper parrot concerns about civil liberties while representing a party hard-wired to trample on those liberties while in office. People are right to ask questions about the detention of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/david-miranda-court-victory-data-police" title=""&gt;David Miranda&lt;/a&gt; for nine hours this week. But Cooper voted for powers to detain suspects for 90 days – 2,160 hours. Her outrage is almost comical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me address directly the two specific decisions that have confronted the government this week. I believed at the time, and still do, that it was entirely reasonable for the government to seek to get leaked documents back from the Guardian or have them destroyed. Along with the information the newspaper had published, it had information that put national security and lives at risk. It was right for us to want that information destroyed. The Guardian had decided not to publish this information: not a single sentence was censored from the newspaper as a result of the information being destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not consulted on the plans to detain him before it happened, and I acknowledge the many concerns raised about the use of &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/may/26/terrorism-act-schedule-7" title=""&gt;schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000&lt;/a&gt; for these purposes. There is obviously a material difference between agreeing by mutual consent that files will be destroyed, and forcibly detaining someone. Terrorism powers should be used proportionately. That is why it is immensely important that the independent reviewer of terrorism powers, David Anderson QC, reports rapidly on whether this was a legitimate use of the Terrorism Act, and whether that legislation should be adjusted. Already, we are planning to limit the schedule 7 powers. We consulted last year on a wide set of improvements – such as reducing the maximum period of detention to six hours and allowing anyone detained for more than 60 minutes access to a lawyer. This autumn we will be taking a bill through parliament to implement these changes. In my view, if Anderson provides a clearly justified recommendation to restrict these powers even further, we should seek to do so in this bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a wider question, however, about this expanding world of data and information sharing. The power of information technology hasn't just transformed our daily lives, it has shifted the very boundaries of this ancient debate about liberty and security. These new technologies have extraordinary liberating potential but also pose new challenges and threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criminals and terrorists now have access to a dizzying array of information, with devastating implications, while the security authorities have new tools with which to track them down. Data-mining techniques have the capacity to make government much more efficient but pose a real risk to personal privacy if taken too far. Social media can create new communities that would never have been possible before, but can also be the source of tragedy, as we have seen in a series of recent young suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a balance must be struck between a libertarian "anything goes" approach, which sees new technology as a way to escape from the reach of the law, and an authoritarian view that sees technology as a new opportunity to intrude into our lives. Technology will continue to evolve and governments worldwide will try to evolve with it. As long as Liberal Democrats are in government, I will ensure that our individual rights are not cast aside in the name of collective security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was amended on 23 August 2013 after a request from the deputy prime minister's office based on legal reasons.

We are working in partnership with the NYT and others to continue reporting these stories," the Guardian said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalists in America are protected by the first amendment which guarantees free speech and in practice prevents the state seeking pre-publication injunctions or "prior restraint".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is intended that the collaboration with the New York Times will allow the Guardian to continue exposing mass surveillance by putting the Snowden documents on GCHQ beyond government reach. Snowden is aware of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaboration echoes that of the partnership forged in 2010 between the Guardian, the New York Times and Der Spiegel in relation to WikiLeaks's release of US military and diplomatic documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US surveillance scandal broke in early June when the Guardian revealed the US was collecting telephone records of millions of American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then the Guardian has exposed mass surveillance of Facebook, Google, Microsoft, eavesdropping by Britain's GCHQ on foreign politicians at G20 summits in London and the secret operation codenamed Tempora, involving mass interception of cable traffic, designed, in the words of GCHQ to "Master the Internet".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq"&gt;GCHQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden"&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity"&gt;UK security and counter-terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files"&gt;The NSA files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/data-protection"&gt;Data protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll"&gt;Lisa O'Carroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com"&gt;theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
